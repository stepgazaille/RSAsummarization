Declaring that thousands of birds and animals are being poisoned , Rep. Mel
Levine -LRB- D-Santa Monica -RRB- and the Wilderness Society called Monday for a federal
investigation into gold mining operations in California and Nevada that use
cyanide to extract the precious metal .


More than 6,400 migratory birds and other animals , including deer , coyotes , kit
foxes , rabbits and chipmunks , have been killed at the Nevada mines since 1984 ,
according to figures compiled by Nevada officials and released at a press
conference Monday at the Federal Building in Westwood .


Most of the mines are in arid areas , and birds and animals searching for water
are attracted to the cyanide-laced holding ponds that are an integral part of
the mining operations . There are 93 such operations in the two states .


`` It 's an environmental scandal taking place in the remotest areas of California
and Nevada , '' Patricia Schifferle , the California-Nevada director of the
Wilderness Society , said Monday . She said the death rate in 1988 was twice
1987 's in Nevada . There are no figures available for wildlife deaths at
California mines .


At the same time , Levine 's office released a letter urging the House
subcommittee on mining and natural resources to request an investigation by the
General Accounting Office , the investigatory arm of Congress .


But the mining industry issued a statement later in the day charging the
Wilderness Society with issuing misleading information .


`` Any characterization that the California mining industry is responsible for
significant numbers of bird deaths or that it disregards its environmental
responsibilities is absolutely untrue , '' said Bill Tilden , chairman of the
mining industry 's Desert Conservation Institute .


An `` informal survey '' of 10 of 93 mining operations turned up fewer than 200
dead birds last year , Tilden said . He said the information was collected by the
U.S. Bureau of Land Management . By the time Tilden issued his statement , Bureau
of Land Management offices had closed and his figures could not be verified .


The call by Levine for a General Accounting Office investigation came on the
eve of a public hearing scheduled for tonight by the Bureau of Land Management
on a controversial plan to open a mine 100 miles south of Las Vegas in the
Castle Mountains of the eastern Mojave Desert where a new 1.5-million-acre
Mojave National Park is proposed .


Known as `` heap leach '' mining , the method has become popular in the last decade
because it enables microscopic bits of gold to be economically extracted from
low-grade ore .


Heap leach mining involves saturating heaps of ore dug from nearby strip mines
with a cyanide solution . The solution , which is about 0.1 % cyanide , bonds to
the bits of gold and is then drained into a holding pond where the gold is
separated from the solution . Companies can produce an ounce of gold for about
$ 200 or less and sell it for about $ 400 . It costs about $ 300 an ounce from deep
mining and standard milling methods .


Schifferle charged Monday that the Bureau of Land Management was `` ready to
approve '' the mining operation proposed by Viceroy Resource Corp. , a Canadian
firm based in Vancouver .


`` The BLM continues to approve these mining operations ... . I believe we have
a case of Valdez-type indifference , '' Schifferle said , referring to
circumstances leading up to the 11-million-gallon crude oil spill March 24 from
the Exxon Valdez in Alaska .


BLM spokeswoman Barbara Maxfield denied Monday that a decision has been made on
the Castle Mountain proposal . But she said the General Mining Law of 1872
requires the bureau to approve the Castle Mountain mine unless it would result
in `` undue or unnecessary '' degradation of the habitat .


Ross Fitzpatrick , president of Viceroy Resources Corp. , could not be reached
for comment Monday . But he told The Times a year ago that steps would be taken
to protect birds and wildlife from entering the ponds , including floating
covers on the surface and the use of air cannons and multicolored flags to
scare birds away .


The Castle Mountain mine proposed by Viceroy would extract about $ 40-million
worth of gold from 2.8 million tons of crushed ore each year , according to
company President Ross Fitzpatrick . The strip mine will be 600 feet deep and
2,200 feet across .


Schifferle warned that , based on the known deaths of birds and wildlife and
other cyanide heap leach gold mines , the mine proposed in the eastern Mojave
should be prohibited .


Schifferle said mine owners are exempt from state and federal hazardous waste
cleanup and prevention laws . She said the mining industry is not required to
pay royalties to the federal government or the cost of cleaning up public lands
and restoring them to their original condition . She pointed out that such
royalties and cleanup charges are routinely paid by the oil and gas industry .


The 7 p.m. BLM hearing tonight at the San Bernardino County Government Center ,
as well as hearings Wednesday in Barstow and Thursday in Las Vegas , are on a
final environmental impact statement . The public comment period closes May 15
and a decision on the proposal is expected in mid-July , Maxfield said .
