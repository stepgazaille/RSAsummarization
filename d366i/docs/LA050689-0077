What fool would pose such a question : `` Should we allow a foreign interest to
extract gold from the American soil of a proposed national park and leave us a
seething , cyanide-laced toxic pit ? '' At best , the popularity of such a proposal
is laughable . Unfortunately , the humor is lost both on the Bureau of Land
Management as well as to our archaic and permissive General Mining Law of 1872 .


The responses which predictably range from shock to incredulous disbelief tell
us that Californians are not humored . The BLM hearing , which should have asked
the question `` whether , '' merely asked `` how . '' But despite this breakdown of the
representative process , thanks to the efforts of Levine and the environmental
consciousness basic to almost all Americans , both the bureau and the Viceroy
Resources Corp. will receive their unsolicited reply .
