We applaud your article on the BLM -LRB- May 24 -RRB- , which provides an informative , if
rare , peek at what is often called the `` forgotten legacy '' in the public lands
system . The message should be clear to anyone reading about the haphazardness
of BLM 's management , especially here in California ; the agency 's policy-making
apparatus is badly adrift . Ultimately , under federal law , Congress must decide
how to protect the California desert .


Today the new regime has failed to offer any substantive , much less minor ,
changes in the agency 's land management programs or policies . As a result , many
illogical , discredited and potentially ruinous practices continue unabated .
Current policies , as contained in the California BLM Desert Plan , would also
sanction large-scale cyanide gold strip mining . Such practices will dry up
surrounding wells and streams and destroy wildlife habitat .


There is a well-documented pattern of mismanagement by BLM in the California
desert . There is a significant leadership vacuum at the highest levels of the
Department of Interior and BLM . Congress must act quickly to protect the
desert . The California Desert Protection Act , introduced by Sen. Alan Cranston
-LRB- D-Calif . -RRB- and Rep. Mel Levine -LRB- D-Santa Monica -RRB- , would ensure that 3 million
acres of the desert will be preserved as national parklands . The National Park
Service , with its respected record on preservation , can be entrusted to enhance
the unique natural qualities found throughout areas such as Death Valley , East
Mojave and Joshua Tree .


This transfer of land from BLM to the Park Service does not threaten to gut
BLM 's management role in the California desert . Under the Cranston-Levine
legislation , there would be an additional 4.5 million acres of BLM wilderness
to manage . Miners , off-road vehicles and other interests would also have
approximately 4.5 million acres to work with , under BLM jurisdiction , of
course .
