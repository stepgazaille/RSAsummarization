The Environmental Protection Agency on Monday began cleaning up thousands of
gallons of hazardous chemicals at a former Burbank metal plating shop that was
abandoned by its owners .


Officials expect the removal of about 36,000 gallons of industrial solvents and
other chemicals at Dynamic Plating to take about five weeks . The action is
designed to prevent reactive chemicals from mixing . Although the chemicals used
in various plating processes do not pose a significant health risk by
themselves , they are potentially very dangerous when mixed , said Dan Shane , who
is coordinating the cleanup .


An emergency work order issued by the EPA said the combination of acids with
cyanide solutions stored nearby could cause the release of hydrogen cyanide ,
which `` would be a major disaster . '' EPA spokesman Terry Wilson declined to
elaborate or speculate on the effects of such a gas release .


Tests also will be conducted to determine if seepage from the shop has
contributed to ground water contamination in the southeast San Fernando Valley .
Soil samples already taken at the site indicate a `` significant amount '' of
solvents have seeped into the ground over the years . High levels of solvents
were detected at depths of up to 55 feet and officials suspect that other
chemicals also might have found their way into the soil .


The building was built as Army barracks during World War II and had been used
as a plating shop since at least 1959 . Because of the wood-framed building 's
age and dilapidated condition , officials feared there was a significant risk of
chemicals spilling or mixing .


The shop , which is in a light-industrial area near Burbank and Victory
boulevards , has been closed since January , according to city records . At that
time , city officials cited shop owners Frank Guerrero and Chuck Ceballos for
exceeding their permitted limits on the amount of waste they were flushing into
the sewer system .


An assessment of the shop by the EPA in August revealed several open vats and
sumps containing 36,000 gallons of chemicals and various industrial wastes .


On Monday , about a dozen workers prepared the site for cleanup by removing
empty containers and evaluating the potential risks . A portable meteorological
station was erected to forecast the spread of a toxic cloud in the event any of
the chemicals combine during the cleanup .


Wilson said the cleanup will cost about $ 1.3 million . The EPA can fine Guerrero
and Ceballos up to three times that amount .


But Guerrero and Ceballos have indicated to city and federal officials that
they are unable to pay for the cleanup . Sidney Troxell , an attorney for the two
men , declined to discuss how they plan to settle the bill . He said Guerrero and
Ceballos were considering declaring bankruptcy , but had not made a final
decision .


Shane said the first priority at the site will be to pump reactive chemicals
into storage tanks and remove them , thus eliminating the immediate risk of
toxic mixture .


Work then will concentrate on removing chemical containers and disposing of
them in an approved facility . Tests also will be conducted to determine the
amount of contamination caused by chemicals seeping into the soil .
