Only 13 years old , Carlos Gallano already had seen friends drown -- or rupture
their eardrums deep underwater . Others were slashed by propellers or attacked
by sharks .


His job was to swim all day , pounding a heavy rock on fragile coral reefs to
drive fish into nets . At night , he 'd fight for space with 300 others crammed on
a filthy , fish-filled deck . His pay for 10 months at sea : $ 75 .


`` The hardship was too much , '' he said . `` We were like slaves .


`` So I escaped . When we got to land , I hid in the cemetery . They tried to hunt
me down . They said I would be beaten if I was caught . ''


Gallano 's tale is the sad story of muro-ami . Originating in Japan , it is a
uniquely dangerous and destructive form of Philippine reef fishing that critics
say combines modern slavery with ecological disaster .


Reefs are crucial to marine life , and scientists say the 7,107 Philippine
islands boast the richest reefs in the world . They are home to an estimated
2,000 species of fish and 500 of coral . Australia 's Great Barrier Reef , by
contrast , has 1,500 species of fish and 400 of coral .


But the Philippine reefs are also the most damaged . Together with muro-ami ,
fishermen using the poison sodium cyanide , homemade explosives and dynamite
have helped to destroy an estimated 70 % of the reefs , a University of the
Philippines study found . Only 6 % were still pristine .


`` The importance to coastal people is extreme , '' warned John McManus , a marine
biologist at the university 's Marine Science Institute . `` Our number one concern
is feeding hungry coastal villagers . And coral reefs are a major source of food
and income for them . ''


Muro-ami is also a source of food and income . Operators say 5,000 teen-agers
and young men currently work off 28 muro-ami boats . Each year they harvest more
than 10,000 metric tons of fish from shallow waters in the Sulu and South China
seas .


Each ship sends scores of swimmers into the sea . Advancing along the reef , the
swimmers jerk long `` scare-lines '' tied to chains or rocks across the coral .
Others , wearing only goggles , hold their breath and dive as much as 100 feet
deep to anchor the nets . As the cordon of swimmers close in , the free-divers go
back down to free the net and haul the catch .


The results , investigators say , are huge profits , mile after mile of shattered
coral and dozens of injuries and deaths .


`` Just imagine 200 or 300 people pounding a coral reef to drive the fish , '' said
Rogelio Gonzales , a local fisherman and village official . `` It destroys
everything . ''


And the risks include deafness , nitrogen narcosis and shark attacks -- 24 have
been recorded . Some lose fingers or toes , smashed between the mother ship and
the outriggers . Others suffer typhoid fever or dysentery from the ship 's
cramped squalor , where sanitation is minimal .


But the divers face the most danger .


`` No scuba diver in his right mind will go anywhere near a net , '' said McManus ,
who has studied muro-ami . `` And these kids have to swim under the net , 90 to 110
feet underwater , holding their breath . If anything happens , they 're dead . ''


Many apparently are buried on a wind-swept beach here . Most graves are marked
by broken coral and simple driftwood crosses , faded in the tropical sun .
Typhoons have washed some graves away , or left some of the crosses tilting
crazily under tangled coconut palms .


`` All the pescadores -LRB- fishermen -RRB- are buried here , '' said Marietta Baltazar ,
councilwoman for the only village , Panlaitan . `` They do not allow burial at sea .
They are religious people . ''


The village of 5,000 nestles against a long beach below steep green hills .
Muro-ami crews are easy to spot , since the sun and sea have bleached their
black hair red . And they have turned the sleepy island 180 miles southwest of
Manila , in the Calamian group of islands , into a mini-boomtown , with bustling
shops , cockfights and bars .


`` Our island is a commercial center now because of muro-ami , '' boasted Cirilo G.
Caco , the barrio captain . `` Without it , people here would starve . ''


That is the dilemma for the government . In 1986 , the Department of Agriculture
tried to ban muro-ami . But officials approved delays while alternative
employment schemes were studied . Muro-ami operators , in turn , agreed to use
less destructive equipment and stop hiring minors .


But in May , investigators found at least 10 young boys working aboard the Dona
Aurea-B , a muro-ami ship with 293 fishermen and crew working a reef near here .
Government divers found that the swimmers had damaged soft underwater polyps
using illegal scare-lines with rocks .


`` It was as terrible as before , '' said Malcolm Sarmiento Jr. , general manager of
the Philippine Fisheries Development Authority , who led the raid . `` It was like
a bulldozer underwater . ''


A Senate committee has held hearings on a permanent ban , but opposition is
strong . One reason is that the head of the House fisheries subcommittee , Rep.
Crisologo Abines , comes from a family that jointly runs the multimillion-dollar
muro-ami monopoly .


The Abines company , the ABS Fish Trading Corp. , arranges for the fishermen and
divers and provides them nets and boats . The mother ships come from Frabal
Fishing Corp. , owned by Manila businessman Francisco Dee .


Records show that ABS and Frabal receive 80 % of the profits , while the
fishermen and divers split the rest after nets , food and operating expenses are
deducted . Since their families borrow money and shop in company-owned stores ,
many fishermen return in debt after 10 months at sea .


`` It 's the reason these are called the slave ships of the Philippines , '' McManus
said .


Most fishermen come from three rural villages in southern Cebu , a large island
about 250 miles to the southeast . It is Rep. Abines ' district , and his family
runs local politics , as well as a bank , stores and buses . More than half the
population depends on muro-ami , and roadside welcome signs say , `` We love
Muro-ami ! ''


Not everyone does . Cebu 's governor , Emilio Osmena , blames muro-ami for
perpetuating `` the most impoverished , illiterate and disadvantaged district '' in
the region .


`` They buy children from families , '' Osmena charged . `` The reason they prefer
children is they eat less , take up less room and cause less trouble . ''


`` It 's child labor , if not slavery , '' he added . `` Hundreds already have died . ''


In one of the Cebu villages , Raymundo Erauda , head teacher in the small Alo
Elementary School , agreed . `` There are no benefits to muro-ami , '' he said ,
shaking his head . `` One of my nephews died . He drowned . He was only 12 years
old . ''


Apolonio Abines Jr. , chairman of the family company , heatedly denied the
charges of deaths and slavery . Few , if any , have died , he said . Coral is not
damaged by current muro-ami operations , he insisted , and all fishermen must be
over 18 years old .


`` Since we imposed the 18-year-old limit , the boys and parents are crying , '' he
added . `` They do n't have any livelihood . ''


His brother , Emiliano Abines , mayor of Oslob , the largest of three villages
where the muro-ami recruiting is done , also denied any undue injuries from
fishing method . `` No fisherman became deaf from diving , '' he said . `` The deafness
comes from an inborn sickness in Oslob , not from diving . ''


And his sister , Encarnacion Go , mayor of nearby Santander , blamed politics for
the criticism . The fishermen enjoy their work , she said . `` You can give them
diving equipment , '' she added . `` They do n't want to use it . ''


But former fisherman Oscar Laurenciala painted a very different picture . Now
28 , he says he barely knew how to swim when he was hired for a muro-ami boat in
the South China Sea in 1981 .


`` A lot of us did not know how to swim , '' he said in Busuanga , near Talampulan .
`` There were many of us who almost drowned . ''


The 300 swimmers and divers usually worked from sunrise to


sunset . They worked reefs up to eight times a day , jiggling long lines hung
with rocks and plastic streamers to scare fish into huge nets .


When he complained that he could n't swim , `` as punishment , we 'd have to stand
under the sun , '' Laurenciala said . And when he lost a scare-line in the waves ,
`` I was beaten by a paddle on the head . ''


One friend was speared in the neck by a swordfish . And others had fingers and
toes crushed by the moving boats . `` A lot got hurt , '' he said .


On board , they slept crowded between racks of drying fish , in fishing-net
hammocks hung three deep . They ate corn grits and salted `` trash fish , '' cooked
on the open deck . They drank unboiled water and washed in the sea .


Often sick , he was docked a full day 's wages if he missed even one drive across
the reef . He was also charged for his food , medicine , plus his share of the
nets , outriggers and fishing gear . After ten months work , he was paid about
$ 100 .


`` I was misled , '' he said . `` I was told the money was big and the work was easy . ''


Finally , he decided to quit and return to Cebu , a 40-hour boat ride away . `` We
were told we 'd be sent home free of charge , '' he said . `` But we 've been stranded
here . How can I go home ? ''
