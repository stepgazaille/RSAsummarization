While few people know Southern California for its mineral wealth , northern San
Diego County -- from the Laguna Mountains in the east to the foothills of
Escondido -- has contributed millions of dollars in gold to the Golden State .


San Diego 's best known mining period -- the Julian gold rush of 1870 -- began
when rancher Fred Coleman spotted gold in a creek in the Cuyamaca Mountains .
When Coleman spread word of his discovery , scores of prospectors raced to the
hills to pan for placer gold in the mountain streams . The miners formed a
mining district , and a town of tents emerged called Emily City .


In San Diego , skepticism over the strike vanished when a load of 1,500 pounds
of gold ore arrived in town in March , 1870 . The San Diego Union reported the
event :


The arrival of so large a quantity of rich gold-bearing quartz created intense
excitement in town . A stampede immediately ensued and the road has now for
several days been lined with teams of every description and men mounted and on
foot in route to the mines . From persons who returned yesterday we learned that
there are now on the ground not less than 600 persons and the number is daily
increasing .


Julian gold fever soon infected the whole of the Southwest . Miners poured into
the region from San Francisco via steamer or overland from Los Angeles .


The miners found lode gold in several hillside areas . The claims bore formal
names such as George Washington , Mount Vernon , The Monroe , and U.S. Grant , as
well as novel titles such as Shoo Fly , April Fool , You Bet , and Do n't Bother
Me .


The first significant town site was laid out by homesteader Drury Bailey and
named `` Julian City '' after his cousin , Mike Julian . A tent city at first , Julian
grew in two years to a population of nearly 2,000 -- half the size of San
Diego . At its gold-rush peak , the town boasted two hotels , two cafes , five
stores , two blacksmith shops , two livery stables , a school , a race track , and
uncounted saloons and dance halls . The town became important politically after
Mike Julian was appointed county assessor -LRB- an attempt to move the county seat
to Julian from San Diego failed -RRB- .


Neighboring mining camps grew up in the region : Branson City , Eastwood , and
Coleman City -LRB- Emily City -RRB- . Banner , located a few miles southwest of Julian ,
became a sizeable town .


The mining boom of Julian-Banner lasted less than five years . In 1873 the camps
produced $ 500,000 in gold , but late in the year , plans for the long-anticipated
Texas and Pacific Railroad collapsed . A severe recession gripped the region .
Gold production began to decline and , by 1876 , most of the mines had closed .
The population of Julian fell to less than 100 people , and Banner became a
ghost town . Between 1870 and 1875 the mines had produced about $ 2 million in
gold .


The late 1800s saw a major revival in mining , helped by the completion of
railroad connections to the north . The new rail and stage lines promoted fresh
interest in mining ventures . The most successful activity came from the
Stonewall Mine south of Julian . Purchased by California Gov. Robert W. Waterman
for $ 75,000 , the mine yielded $ 1 million in gold between 1888 and 1891 .


Gold mining was not confined to the mountains of the northeast county .


In the 1890s , prospectors found gold in the Escondido region . The
Cleveland-Pacific , Oro Fino , and Cravath mines -- located only 2 miles
southeast of the Escondido city hall -- produced about $ 150,000 -LRB- at $ 20 per
ounce -RRB- in the early century .


The Cleveland-Pacific Mining Company developed the most important site from
1896 through 1911 . A 350-foot incline shaft followed a vein of gold-bearing
quartz . Ore was processed at the site using a five-stamp mill and 10-foot high
tanks of cyanide . Slow activity continued from the 1920s until about 1932 , when
all mining stopped and the shafts were dynamited shut . Citrus and avocado
groves soon covered all traces of the mines .


Reminders of the San Diego County gold producing days still exist , though .


Old mine dumps near the junction of San Pasqual Valley Road and Bear Valley
Parkway can be seen today as low hills .


The site of the Stonewall Mine near the southeast shore of Cuyamaca Reservoir
is clearly marked within Cuyamaca State Park and easily reached by visitors .


The Eagle-High Peak Mine of Julian produces gold to this day and even provides
guided tours of the diggings .
