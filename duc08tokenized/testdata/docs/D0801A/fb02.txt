facebook 's stock price was down by more than 7 % march 19 , following a weekend of backlash against the company , after it was revealed that trump campaign consultant cambridge analytica harvested the data of up to 50 million facebook users without their permission .
the company has lost $ 42 billion in value since its close on friday at the time of publishing
generally , facebook 's business has been nearly invulnerable to political scandal , with the company posting record quarter after record quarter , despite revelations that russia and other malicious actors were exploiting the platform .
but the cambridge analytica story has already pushed authorities and lawmakers on both sides of the atlantic to threaten action , raising the specter of regulation that could endanger its monopoly-like status , and scare off advertisers .
analysts and observers are divided over the company 's future , with some more optimistic than others .
daniel ives , an analyst at gbh , said in a note to investors that with more pressure from washington , `` modest changes to their business model around advertising and news feeds/content could be in store over the next 12 to 18 months . '' .
while the threat of regulation will be concerning to investors , ives called it more of a `` headline risk '' that will dominate the news cycle for now , rather than a long-term game-changer , and added that he was not worried that the company 's `` advertising fortress '' is at risk .
conversely , stephen guilfoyle at the street advises investors not to buy on facebook 's dipping price , warning that it might take a while for facebook 's stock to swing back up .
before the cambridge analytica news broke , market research firm emarketer put out analysis that predicted that facebook 's -lrb- and google 's -rrb- share in the digital ad market in the us will be slightly falling in the next several years .
`` facebook 's user growth in the us has slowed down and is now about the same as that of internet users , while news feed ad prices may be reaching their limit , '' said in a release monica peart , senior forecasting director .
the good news for facebook is that instagram is only growing , and will surpass 5 % of the us ad market this year -lrb- to facebook 's 19.6 % -rrb- .
