facebook shares tumbled seven per cent monday on reports that a political consultancy that worked on u.s. president donald trump ` s campaign gained inappropriate access to data on more than 50 million users , sparking broader concerns about data privacy and security .
the drop equated to a loss of roughly us$ 40 billion in total value for the social media giant , according to marketwatch .
the stock was set for its worst day since september 2012 and was down about 13 per cent from its all-time high hit on feb. 1 , entering what is called correction territory .
the sharp loss for facebook is dragging other technology companies lower as u.s. stock indexes skid .
facebook said friday that the data mining company cambridge analytica improperly obtained data on some of its users , and that it had suspended cambridge while it investigates .
facebook said the company obtained data from 270,000 people who downloaded a purported research app that was described as a personality test .
the new york times and the guardian reported that cambridge was able to tap the profiles of more than 50 million facebook users without their permission .
facebook first learned of the breach more than two years ago but had n't disclosed it .
a british legislator said facebook had misled officials while senator amy klobuchar of minnesota said facebook ceo mark zuckerberg should testify before the senate judiciary committee .
other technology companies also struggled . microsoft slid $ 1.86 , or 2 per cent , to $ 92.74 .
this is a crisis for facebook , said daniel ives , chief strategy officer and head of technology research for gbh insights , adding the social media giant will have to work hard to reassure users , investors and governments .
ives said wall street is more concerned about the latest situation than it was about issues like facebook 's platform spreading fake news .
that 's because cambridge reportedly got access to the personal data of a large number of users , and the backlash suggests facebook may face more regulation or could lose users , advertisers or advertising revenue .
he estimated that $ 5 billion in annual revenue for facebook might be at risk and that the company has to work hard to assure users and government agencies . he said the situation could create problems for other tech companies , especially twitter and alphabet 's youtube unit .
