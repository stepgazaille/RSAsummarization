cambridge analytica 's acting ceo said in a statement today that the company will undergo an independent third-party audit to determine whether it still holds any data covertly obtained from facebook users .
the acting ceo , alexander tayler , apologized for the recent controversy , and said cambridge analytica believed the data had been obtained `` in line with facebook 's terms of service and data protection laws . ''
as it has claimed before , cambridge analytica says it destroyed the mishandled facebook data years ago , but new reporting has brought that claim into question .
facebook said recently it was working with a firm to conduct its own audit of cambridge analytica , but the investigation is on pause while the united kingdom ` s information commissioner 's office -lrb- ico -rrb- works on its own probe .
tayler says the company is cooperating with the ico .
tayler , while casting aspersions on the contractor christopher wylie , who has become a major source for reporting on cambridge analytica , also promised to release more information on the company 's practices .
while discussing scl elections , cambridge analytica 's parent organization , he seemed to allude to comments made by his predecessor , alexander nix , about using entrapment for political gain .
`` we take the disturbing recent allegations of unethical practices in our non-us political business very seriously , '' tayler writes .
`` the board has launched a full and independent investigation into scl elections ' past practices , and its findings will be shared publicly . ''
