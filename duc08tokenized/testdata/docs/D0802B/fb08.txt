facebook lost about $ 119 billion of its value on thursday , marking the biggest one-day loss in u.s. market history .
the company 's shares plunged $ 41.24 , or almost 19 percent , to $ 176.26 a day after the social media giant reported disappointing results .
the slide is the largest decline in market capitalization in history , exceeding intel 's $ 91 billion single-day loss in september 2000 , according to bloomberg data .
founder and ceo mark zuckerberg saw his fortune drop by $ 15.9 billion to roughly $ 71 billion . his personal loss alone , if only on paper , exceeds the value of companies such as molson coors and macy 's , which have market values of $ 14 billion and $ 12 billion , respectively .
investors were spooked by facebook 's forecast showing that its number of active users is growing less quickly than expected , while the company also took a hit from europe 's new privacy laws .
the report , which marked facebook 's first full quarter since the cambridge analytica scandal , startled investors with a bevy of red flags about setbacks to its revenue and user growth .
indeed , the drop thursday morning was sharper than the multi-day stock slide in march following revelations of data misappropriation by cambridge and others .
-lrb- facebook shares dropped 17.8 percent then , bottoming out at $ 151.65 on march 28 . -rrb-
`` the perceived narrative surrounding facebook has changed after yesterday 's earnings announcement , '' said jeff henriksen , managing partner at thorpe abbotts capital .
`` the market seems to be questioning the quality of growth seen in the past . ''
the share collapse merely returned facebook shares to a level last seen in early may , a sign of just how bullish investor expectations had been running .
at that time , the stock was still recovering from an earlier battering over a major privacy scandal .
facebook is hardly a stranger to a volatile stock price and has rebounded from previous mishaps , including cambridge analytica .
while several analysts downgraded the stock , others say they still have faith in the company to grow over the long-term .
`` even the best hitters strike out sometimes , '' wrote wedbush analyst michael pachter , who lowered his 12-month price target to $ 250 from $ 275 , in a research report . `` in our view , the sell-off is overdone and largely unwarranted . ''
still , investors were n't prepared for many of the bombshells dropped by facebook chief financial officer david wehner .
a hit from europe .
european advertising revenue growth in europe `` decelerated more quickly than other regions , '' partially because of the new european privacy laws , wehner said .
that surprised investors because of the belief that the new laws would n't hurt revenue .
the new laws were only in effect for one month of the quarter , which means the company may feel more of an impact in the current quarter .
the new regulations are also affecting user growth in the region because of the impact of requiring consumers to opt-in to facebook and to linking their accounts to third-party websites , pachter said .
`` the implementation of gdpr gave a large number of facebook users control over their privacy , and it should have been patently obvious to investors -lrb- and to us -rrb- that allowing users control would result in slightly lower engagement , '' he noted , alluding to europe 's general data protection regulation privacy rules .
over the long term , gdpr may end up favoring facebook and other large companies that have the resources to adapt to new requirements .
they could similarly disadvantage smaller , lesser known companies that do n't have the resources to comply and which could face big fines if they do n't .
instagram worthy ?
some investors were also dismayed with facebook 's revelation about instagram stories , which allow users to post videos or photos that disappear after a day .
like facebook , instagram depends on ads to generate revenue , and stories is supposed to help sell more ads .
but wehner said the product has `` lower levels of monetization , '' while adding that the company plans to invest in growing the service .
`` that 's going to have a negative impact on revenue growth , '' he noted .
profitability woes .
facebook has drawn investors because of its fast growth of users and profits .
yet both categories are facing headwinds .
in case of the latter , wehner noted that `` total expense growth will exceed revenue growth in 2019 , '' pushing down operating margins .
investors closely watch operating margins because they serve as an important metric for profitability .
the lower the operating margin , the less profitable the business .
facebook warned that its operating margins would fall from its current 44 percent to the `` mid-30s . '' .
user growth was `` lackluster , '' pachter noted .
so is it time to unfriend facebook ?
some analysts argue that its long-term outlook is favorable , with rbc capital markets ' mark mahaney writing that the sell-off may represent `` one of the best entry points you can get on fb , '' according to bloomberg .
and in the view of btig analyst rich greenfield , facebook is making an investment that will pay off down the road .
`` facebook is actively choosing to make less money , deprioritizing near-term monetization to drive engagement to even higher levels to capture even more of their 2.5 billion monthly users ' time and attention , '' he wrote .
`` legacy media executives ... should not be rejoicing -- they should be afraid , very afraid . ''
