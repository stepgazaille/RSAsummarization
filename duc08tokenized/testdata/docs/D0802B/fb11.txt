facebook 's share price is plunging , setting the company up for the worst day in stock market history .
the company has lost more than $ 100 billion in value , and its share price has dropped nearly 20 per cent .
that has meant that mark zuckerberg alone has seen a fifth of his net worth destroyed by the market .
the reasons for such a dramatic day of trading are complex -- but , according to some analysts , have been a long time coming .
the drops appear to be the result of vast amounts of criticism and concern all around the world .
from europe 's new data regulations to the cost of trying to deal with worries about facebook 's security , the company long held as a vast wall street success story appears to be running into problems .
facebook 's share price plunge came immediately after the company had announced its latest results .
as soon as they were revealed , investors rushed to sell shares in the company .
the results were not simply bad this time around -- they came with a warning that facebook might be hit by problems in the coming years , too , because of the costs of improving privacy safeguards and slowing usage in its biggest advertising markets .
there are a wide variety of possible reasons for those problems , many of which could impact the company for years to come . here is a selection of some of those issues .
advertising slowing down .
facebook likes to sell itself as a technology company : it often talks about connecting people , and most of its public statements are about new features and innovation .
but it is really an advertising company , at least in terms of its profits .
those profits are now slowing down , the company said .
that is in part because of technology like ad blockers , which allow people to ban those ads , the company said .
facebook claimed that the new european data protection regulations known as gdpr only accounted for a limit part of its downturn .
but they were also only in effect for a small part of the time being reported .
data protection regulations of this kind could have significant problems for companies like facebook .
but in the long term they might work out well for facebook , at least against its smaller rivals , because the massive company has more resources to deal with the complexities and difficulties of the privacy law .
security and privacy concerns .
facebook also makes its money by showing a wide variety of content , and collecting data about the people who are watching it .
but both of those activities have come under threat in recent months , amid new concerns about how secure and private the site really is .
mark zuckerberg said during the company 's earnings call that the company 's attempts to address those problems will hurt its profits .
they include a wide variety of changes , including recruiting far more content moderators who will check over posts on the site and ensure that they are not problematic for those that see them .
`` as i 've said on past calls , we 're investing so much in security that it will significantly impact our profitability , '' ceo mark zuckerberg said in an earnings call .
`` we 're starting to see that this quarter . '' .
users leaving -- or at least not joining .
this has long been the fear for facebook : it requires new users to grow , and it might simply have run out of people to recruit .
what 's more , there is an increasing concern that young people are leaving as older ones join .
`` teens are abandoning - or just not joining the site - as ` oldies ' migrate there , '' said richard holway , chairman at uk tech analyst house techmarketview .
the company hopes to offset some of this with its move to other platforms , such as instagram . but popular as those are facebook itself still remains the company 's biggest product by far , and growth overall now appears to be slipping .
