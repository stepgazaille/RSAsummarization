san francisco -- left-leaning political activists accused facebook of censorship when the social media giant removed an event listing this week that it said was part of a new disinformation campaign with ties to russia .

facebook said it had to act quickly to disclose that inauthentic operators were behind an upcoming event in washington to counter a white-supremacist rally inspired by the deadly demonstration in charlottesville last year .
`` resisters , '' the page that created the event , was among the 32 pages and accounts facebook removed tuesday .
however , activists who had worked with resisters said the counterprotest they planned against a far-right rally was legitimate -- and that facebook was harming their ability to combat the rise of white supremacy .
the event , called `` no unite the right 2 dc '' and promoted by resisters along with other left-leaning groups , was collateral damage in facebook 's battle against disinformation , they said .
facebook has `` delegitimized our whole event -- and all the work that folks across the d.c. area have put a lot of time and effort into , '' said caleb-michael files , an organizer of the march to confront white supremacy , a group that was organized after the charlottesville protests , and a co-host of the counterprotest event page .
he said he was much angrier at the social network than at russia .
`` russians might have been there , but russians are not creating and invoking these feelings .
these are real feelings , not internet-created feelings . ''
the incidents show how facebook 's fight against disinformation and other malicious actors is increasingly butting up against the company 's mission to be a powerful organizing platform for communities -- and represents an unexpected twist to facebook 's disclosure , which many had applauded .
internet activists often connect anonymously and use tools to conceal their identities -- the very tactics that russian operators have also used .
facebook has shown a reluctance to censor speech , as long as that speech does not violate its policies , which are the subject of debate .
last year , under pressure after the `` unite the right '' rally in charlottesville turned deadly , facebook began banning individuals and groups who associated with the gathering , as well as an event page for the protest itself .
facebook provided little evidence about why it deemed resisters and the other pages inauthentic this week , citing security concerns .
the company declined to identify the forces behind any of the pages and accounts it removed tuesday , saying the company was not in a position to do so accurately .
but facebook did say that an account tied to a russian troll army , the internet research agency , had served as an administrator of the resisters page for seven minutes .
another ira account -- disabled in 2017 -- shared a facebook event hosted by the resisters page , too .
`` facebook 's decision to remove the event was about addressing the coordinated inauthentic behavior we identified and maintaining the security of our services , '' said facebook spokesman andy stone .
`` we ban hate organizations from our platform and are encouraged to see people using facebook to stand up against white supremacy . ''
some lawmakers and experts were quick to attribute the activity to russia , which also used facebook , twitter and other tech platforms to interfere in the 2016 election .
four co-hosts of the event who were contacted by the washington post said facebook had gone too far in its decision to block a page that had the support of so many legitimate activists -- and questioned whether their movement had in fact been infiltrated by russia .
when facebook became aware of the groups two weeks ago , executives weighed whether taking them down would hurt the ability of legitimate activists to organize , said a person familiar with the company 's thinking .
they ultimately decided that if the event took place , the harm would be worse because the event would have been tainted by the potential russian involvement -- if that information became public , the person said .
shortly after president trump 's state of the union address this year , brendan orsinger , a 36-year-old washington-based activist , said that he heard from a woman named mary .
the woman , who from her profile appeared to be an activist in new york , had a simple request , he said : would he care to join the facebook group she was involved with , called resisters , as an administrator ?
he had been involved in coordinating protests on the night of the speech , and the name resisters had a certain appeal .
`` if you have the name resist in the title of your page ... in a post-trump social media world , people are going to clickbait the hell out of it .
it can gain a lot of followership really quickly , '' he said .
mary 's request did n't seem like a big deal , he said .
becoming one of a handful of administrators would give him the ability to promote events and post to the page , which had more than 10,000 followers .
as a self-described anti-fascist activist , orsinger appeared to share similar goals with the ostensibly left-leaning group , which billed itself as a feminist and anti-fascist community .
so he told mary that he 'd be willing to help .
orsinger began posting information about causes and events over the next several months .
he said that his interactions with mary -- he did not want to give her last name for fear of violating her privacy -- seemed normal overall , and that he did n't see `` any ulterior motives or agendas . ''
screenshots of the resisters page saved by the internet archive on two occasions earlier this year show it filled with feminist-themed memes on subjects such as female scientists , birth control and meryl streep .
but there were a few `` yellow flags , '' orsinger added .
for one , mary did not want to meet in person or talk on the phone .
in late june , other administrators of resisters created the unite the right 2 dc event page in response to far-right groups obtaining a permit to hold a rally in washington in august .
the administrators began to invite other left-leaning and anti-fascist groups to become hosts , including millennials for revolution , march to confront white supremacy , workers against racism , smash racism dc and tune out trump .
the washington post spoke to four of these groups , in addition to orsinger .
one organizer of the groups said that orsinger 's presence as an administrator gave them a feeling of trust because they knew him personally .
late monday night , a member of facebook 's government team contacted orsinger via email , saying , `` i 'm reaching out to set up a time to discuss an event you are listed as a host of on facebook , '' according to a copy of the correspondence reviewed by the washington post .
the company sent a separate email to other activists the same night , explaining it had shuttered the event because it was `` created by someone establishing an inauthentic account that has been associated with coordinated inauthentic behavior . ''
more than 3,000 people on facebook said they were interested in the event or would attend before the listing was removed .
orsinger and other activists learned that their page had been taken down only after news stories came out tuesday about the purge . when he finally spoke to the employee tuesday , he expressed frustration that the removal was done with such short notice . `` for facebook to do it without any consideration is just really disheartening , '' said orsinger . `` it 's almost like facebook has a disinformation campaign against us . ''
facebook offered to share a new event listing so that organizers could keep users informed .
nevertheless , they still plan to turn out at the white house later this month -- and are trying again to use facebook to drive interest .
activists were skeptical of facebook 's motives .
ome questioned whether the company could have achieved the same effect just by blocking the resisters page , rather than the entire event .
`` they deleted an event , giving the organizers almost no warning , because they were under political pressure from losing 20 % of their stock price , '' said dylan petrohilos , an administrator for smash racism dc , which was a co-host of the event page .
`` they essentially made us into a political pawn . ''
`` this kind of behavior is not allowed on facebook because we do n't want people or organizations creating networks of accounts to mislead others about who they are , or what they are doing , '' facebook said in response .
orsinger now said he was questioning everything about his interactions with mary .
but he said he felt angrier at facebook than at her .
`` if russian bots or russian influence helped us amplify stuff , i do n't know how i feel about that , '' he said .
`` maybe i feel the same way donald trump feels about the help . ''
mary 's profile disappeared this week after facebook 's latest sweep , orsinger said , a vague note about how her profile was no longer available left in her place .
