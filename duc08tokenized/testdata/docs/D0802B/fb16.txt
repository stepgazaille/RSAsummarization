tech firms like facebook should be made liable for `` harmful and misleading '' material on their websites and pay a levy so they can be regulated , british lawmakers said , warning of a crisis in democracy due to misuse of personal data .
facebook has increasingly become a focus of the media committee 's inquiry into `` fake news '' after the data of 87 million users was improperly accessed by british-headquartered consultancy cambridge analytica .
the cost of higher privacy standards will hit facebook 's profit margins for several years , the firm said on wednesday , wiping over $ 120 billion us off its share price , and the company is coming under concerted regulatory scrutiny in britain , the united states and the european union .
`` companies like facebook made it easy for developers to scrape user data and to deploy it in other campaigns without their knowledge or consent , '' damian collins , chair of the digital , culture , media and sport committee , said in a statement .
`` they must be made responsible , and liable , for the way in which harmful and misleading content is shared on their sites . ''
the committee 's interim report and collins 's comments were embargoed until july 29 .
other news organizations broke the embargo after a copy of the report was published online by dominic cummings , who ran the officially designated vote leave campaign in the eu referendum .
collins ripped facebook for allowing russian agencies to use its platform to spread disinformation and influence elections .
`` i believe what we have discovered so far is the tip of the iceberg , '' he said , adding that more work needs to be done to expose how fake accounts target people during elections .
`` the ever-increasing sophistication of these campaigns , which will soon be helped by developments in augmented reality technology , make this an urgent necessity . ''
augmented reality has the ability to show convincing audio or video of things that did not really happen , such as public figures saying things they did not actually say .
the standards of accuracy and impartiality which tech companies are held to could be based on regulator ofcom 's rules for television and radio , the lawmakers said .
the committee began its work in january 2017 , interviewing 61 witnesses during 20 hearings that took on an investigatory tone not normally found in such forums in the house of commons .
the report criticized facebook chief mark zuckerberg for failing to appear before the panel and said his stand-ins were `` unwilling or unable to give full answers to the committee 's questions . ''
` our democracy is at risk '
one of the committee 's recommendations is that the era of light-touch regulation for social media must come to an end .
social media companies can no longer avoid oversight by describing themselves as platforms , because they use technology to filter and shape the information users see .
nor are they publishers , since that model traditionally commissions and pays for content .
`` we recommend that a new category of tech company is formulated , which tightens tech companies ' liabilities , and which is not necessarily either a ` platform ' or a ` publisher , ' '' the report said .
`` we anticipate that the government will put forward these proposals in its white paper later this year . ''
the committee also said that the information commissioner 's office -lrb- ico -rrb- needs more money so it can hire technical experts to be the `` sheriff in the wild west of the internet . ''
the funds would come from a levy on the tech companies , much in the same way as the banks pay for the upkeep of the financial conduct authority .
the ico earlier this month fined facebook for the cambridge analytica scandal .
cambridge analytica , which was hired by donald trump 's campaign in 2016 , has denied its work on the u.s. president 's election made use of the data in question .
`` our democracy is at risk , and now is the time to act , to protect our shared values and the integrity of our democratic institutions , '' the committee said .
