-lrb- reuters -rrb- - shares in ford motor co -lrb- f.n -rrb- took a steep dive on wednesday as investors soured on a disappointing profit outlook for 2018 and statements that the no. 2 u.s. automaker 's turnaround plans will take years to bear fruit .
in afternoon trading , ford shares were down more than 7 percent , the largest intraday drop for the company 's stock since july 2016 .
at an investor conference in detroit late tuesday , ford provided estimated profits for 2017 and a 2018 outlook that lagged wall street expectations .
the company blamed the disappointing forecast on higher costs for steel , aluminum and other metals , as well as currency volatility , which it said could cost the u.s. automaker $ 1.6 billion in 2018 .
ford said cost-cutting actions were underway and significant benefits would come `` in 2020 and later . '' .
the forecast came the same day that detroit rival general motors co -lrb- gm.n -rrb- provide a better-than-expected earnings outlook for 2018 and said revamped pickup truck models would boost its 2019 results .
morgan stanley analyst adam jonas said ford 's turnaround efforts may require a couple of years of negative revisions of about 20 percent each annually in ford 's profit .
`` for a rather impatient market looking for auto opportunities with little risk in 2018 , ford 's outlook presents a challenge , '' jonas said .
ford said tuesday its business structure was `` out of sync '' with its revenue .
it plans to cut the number of passenger-car models and develop more trucks and sport utility vehicles focused on profitable niches like rugged off-road models .
in a statement on wednesday , ford spokesman bradley carroll said those measures `` will create sustained value over the long term . '' .
in a client note deutsche bank analyst rod lache wrote `` ford 's strategy will take several years to take hold ... and the company will face plenty of risks in the interim . '' .
`` we expect the street 's overall take will be neutral to negative , '' he added .
morgan stanley 's jonas said ford 's story was vague and unstructured compared with gm , which has a product mix concentrated on hotter segments and has communicated better on newer ventures into self-driving cars and ride-sharing .
by tuesday 's close , ford 's stock had risen 3.7 percent in the past 12 months , underperforming an 18.3 percent increase in gm 's shares .
the dow jones u.s. automobiles and parts index . djusap increased about 22 percent in that period .
ford will report fourth-quarter results after markets close on jan. 24 , while gm will report feb. 6 .
barclays analyst brian johnson wrote that the presentation was a reminder that it will take ford time to develop electric vehicles and self-driving cars and that `` we have a long journey ahead . ''
in afternoon trading on the new york stock exchange , ford shares were down about 7.3 percent at $ 12.14 .
