what happened .
shares of ford motor company -lrb- nyse : f -rrb- closed down 7 % on wednesday , after the company announced preliminary 2017 earnings that fell short of wall street 's expectations and gave pessimistic guidance for 2018 .
so what .
ford executives told analysts at an investor conference in detroit on tuesday evening that the company 's adjusted 2017 earnings will come in at $ 1.78 per share .
analysts polled by thomson reuters had expected earnings of $ 1.83 per share , on average .
ford also said that it expects its adjusted 2018 earnings to be even lower than its disappointing 2017 result , falling between $ 1.45 and $ 1.70 per share .
there was one bit of good news for ford shareholders : the company declared a $ 500 million supplemental dividend , or $ 0.13 per share , to be paid in the first quarter .
ford will report its fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 results on wednesday , jan. 24 .
ford 's earnings miss and downbeat guidance were a sharp contrast to the guidance provided by rival general motors -lrb- nyse : gm -rrb- earlier in the day .
gm said that its 2017 pre-tax profit will be a record , falling at the `` high end '' of the guidance range it gave a year ago , $ 6.00 to $ 6.50 per share , and that it expects 2018 's result to be similar .
now what .
it 's worth noting that a year ago , ford gave pessimistic guidance that stood in sharp contrast to gm 's upbeat outlook -- and that both companies largely delivered on their guidance .
ford 's story does n't look likely to improve anytime soon .
cfo bob shanks told the analysts that higher costs for raw materials and currency volatility will cost the company about $ 1.6 billion this year .
a cost-cutting effort is under way , but shanks said that likely wo n't have a major impact on ford 's bottom line until 2020 .
it leaves ford investors wondering : when will the blue oval return to a profit-growth path ?
