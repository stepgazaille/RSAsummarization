detroit -lrb- reuters -rrb- - ford motor co -lrb- f.n -rrb- will significantly increase its planned investments in electric vehicles to $ 11 billion by 2022 and have 40 hybrid and fully electric vehicles in its model lineup , chairman bill ford said on sunday at the detroit auto show .
the investment figure is sharply higher than a previously announced target of $ 4.5 billion by 2020 , ford executives said , and includes the costs of developing dedicated electric vehicle architectures .
ford 's engineering , research and development expenses for 2016 , the last full year available , were $ 7.3 billion , up from $ 6.7 billion in 2015 .
ford chief executive jim hackett told investors in october the automaker would slash $ 14 billion in costs over the next five years and shift capital investment away from sedans and internal combustion engines to develop more trucks and electric and hybrid cars .
of the 40 electrified vehicles ford plans for its global lineup by 2022 , 16 will be fully electric and the rest will be plug-in hybrids , executives said .
`` we 're all in on this and we 're taking our mainstream vehicles , our most iconic vehicles , and we 're electrifying them , '' ford told reporters .
`` if we want to be successful with electrification , we have to do it with vehicles that are already popular . ''
general motors co -lrb- gm.n -rrb- , toyota motor corp -lrb- 7203 . t -rrb- and volkswagen ag -lrb- vowg _ p.de -rrb- have already outlined aggressive plans to expand their electric vehicle offerings and target consumers who want luxury , performance and an suv body style - or all three attributes in the same vehicle .
mainstream auto makers are reacting in part to pressure from regulators in china , europe and california to slash carbon emissions from fossil fuels .
they also are under pressure from
tesla inc -lrb- tsla.o -rrb- 's success in creating electric sedans and suvs that inspire would-be owners to line up outside showrooms and flood the company with orders .
gm said last year it would add 20 new battery electric and fuel cell vehicles to its global lineup by 2023 , financed by robust profits from traditional internal combustion engine vehicles in the united states and china .
gm chief executive mary barra has promised investors the detroit automaker will make money selling electric cars by 2021 .
volkswagen said in november it would spend $ 40 billion on electric cars , autonomous driving and new mobility services by the end of 2022 -- significantly more than when it announced two months earlier it would invest more than 20 billion euros on electric and self-driving cars through 2030 .
toyota is racing to commercialize a breakthrough battery technology during the first half of the 2020s with the potential to cut the cost of making electric cars .
ford 's additional investments in electric vehicles contrasted with many of the vehicle launches at the detroit show which featured trucks and suvs .
on sunday evening , daimler ag -lrb- daign.de -rrb- unveiled its new g-class suv , a bulky off roader , in an abandoned movie theater in downtown detroit once used as a set for the movie `` 8 mile . ''
daimler ceo dieter zetsche hinted to former california gov.
arnold schwarzenegger during an exchange on stage next to the g-class that daimler would someday have an electric version of the vehicle .
suvs figured in ford 's electric vehicle presentation .
the automaker 's president of global markets , jim farley , said on sunday that ford would bring a high-performance electric utility vehicle to market by 2020 .
the company will begin production of a hybrid version of its popular f-150 truck at a plant in dearborn , michigan , in 2020 .
`` what we learned from this first cycle of electrification is people want really nice products , '' farley said .
` think big '
ford 's shift to the electric vehicle strategy has been more than six months in the making after hackett replaced former chief executive mark fields in may .
the plan was finalized in recent months after an extensive review , a person familiar with the process said .
in october , ford disclosed it had formed a team to accelerate global development of electric vehicles , whose mission is to `` think big '' and `` make quicker decisions . ''
some of the electric vehicles will be produced with ford 's jv in china aimed at the chinese market .
one aim of ford 's `` team edison '' is to identify and develop electric-vehicle partnerships with other companies , including suppliers , in some markets , according to sherif marakby , vice president of autonomous vehicles and electrification .
china , india , france and the united kingdom all have announced plans to phase out vehicles powered by combustion engines and fossil fuels between 2030 and 2040 .
