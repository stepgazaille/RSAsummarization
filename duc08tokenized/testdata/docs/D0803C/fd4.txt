ford announces limited-edition 2019 mustang bullitt available only in black and dark green as a nod to the steve mcqueen and car chase films .
the mustang that steve mcqueen drove into hollywood history for the 1968 movie `` bullitt '' emerged for the first time in 40 years sunday at the detroit auto show in tandem with the debut of a new , limited-edition 2019 mustang bullitt .
`` this is probably the holy grail if there is one , '' said mark gessler , president of the historic vehicle association .
`` it 's one of the most important artifacts of the 20th century in terms of automotive history . it is a national cultural treasure . ''
mckeel hagerty , ceo of the world 's largest classic car insurer , said after ford 's event sunday that the movie car likely would sell for more than $ 4 million .
he noted that the original batmobile sold for $ 4.6 million in 2013 , and the james bond aston martin db5 sold for $ 4.1 million in 2010 .
mcqueen filmed some of the chase scenes himself in the warner bros. classic that depicts a cop chasing hit men through the hills of san francisco .
real speed .
real crashes .
real point of view of the driver .
it was the first of the furious .
on sunday , it was part of the introduction of a modern , high-powered revival mustang .
as it turns out , the 1968 car has been in a family garage , quietly waiting for the film 's 50th anniversary .
its owner died years ago , leaving a grieving son to hold on to a collector car found in a classified ad from road & track magazine in 1974 .
`` we kept it a secret in the family for so long , hiding in plain sight , '' sean kiernan , 36 , of hendersonville , tenn. , told the free press .
`` we hoped to restore it , but then my dad got parkinson 's and i had my first daughter and life was happening . ''
he continued , `` thing is , everybody wants to be able to honor their father .
me and him were more best friends than father and son .
i was lost when he passed away .
this is a huge moment .
for our family , it 's almost like a finale . ''
ford has been working with kiernan since he reached out two years ago .
on sunday , kiernan , an automotive paint manager who drives a 2014 gt mustang california special , was part of the north american international auto show introducing the public to the new mustang bullitt .
the special model , due out this summer , will be available only in shadow black or dark highland green .
it has a 5.0-liter v8 engine that packs at least 475 horsepower and 420 pound-feet of torque .
it tops out at 163 miles per hour -- an 8-mph increase over the latest mustang gt .
like the original bullitt , the third-generation vehicle lacks stripes , spoilers or badges .
`` it does n't need to scream about anything .
it 's just cool , '' said chief designer darrell behmer .
the all-new mustang bullitt is equipped with manual transmission , and the gear shifter features a white cue ball shift knob as a nod to the original .
standard equipment reflects a new era , with a heated leather steering wheel and high-tech amenities .
features pay tribute to the car mcqueen drove , with chrome accents around the grille and front windows , classic torque thrust 19-inch aluminum wheels , a black front grille .
only the circular faux gas cap bullitt logo on the rear center is visible on the exterior .
the leather-trimmed interior features green accent stitching on the dashboard , door panels , center console and seats .
`` it has to have the right attitude , it has to be unique in some way from a mustang gt and , more than anything , it has to be badass , '' said chief engineer carl widmann .
two identical 1968 mustang gt fastbacks were used in the film , which debuted oct. 17 , 1968 .
the hero vehicle was sold by the studio to a private buyer and the other , used in so many chase scenes , went to a salvage yard .
the latter vehicle resurfaced in baja california , in early 2017 , but the other was lost .
until now .
`` the car shows the gentle patina of time .
it has rust marks .
this is a remarkable moment , '' said gessler , who noted that detroit will be the first stop before a national tour that includes washington , d.c.
`` steve mcqueen wanted to create the most realistic chase scene ever on film .
he found a director , peter yates , and warner brothers gave him the reins .
they took four weeks to shoot an 11-minute chase scene . ''
mcqueen had all the badging on the car removed .
it was recognizable from just its angles and silhouettes .
and that 's why the new model is so sparse , said kevin marti , owner of marti auto works in el mirage , ariz. , who created and maintains the database for every ford vehicle built since 1967 .
`` this car is so iconic that you do n't even need to put a name on the thing .
that speaks to the confidence ford has . ''
as the licensee of ford production records , he tracks every vehicle identification number for more than 140 million cars , and he notes style and color trends of each era .
in the 1960s , popular cars were avocado green , white and red .
in the 1970s , automakers turned to browns , yellows and earthy colors .
now consumers lean toward silver , white and black .
so dark highland green will make a statement .
it is a throwback color on a throwback car .
` that is one sexy car '
people have asked why ford wanted to do a third-generation mustang bullitt , having created 2001 and 2008 editions already .
the company simply could n't resist .
`` you will have a mix of people who have an affinity with the car based on the movie when they saw it or when they owned a previous version .
but you will have people who may have no idea about the history or background and will look and say , ` that is one sexy car .
i have to go buy it , ' '' said mark schaller , marketing manager for mustang .
leslie daniels , 73 , of detroit , a former ford assembly line chipper and metal pourer , used to drive his aunt 's orange mustang gt with a white convertible top .
`` i love the different sounds that bullitt makes , the roaring , '' he said .
`` and steve mcqueen is one of those movie stars that stays in your mind after all this time . ''
meanwhile , many millennials have no knowledge of the film .
ford thought of everything .
not just the huge -lrb- young -rrb- consumer market , but honoring history .
the company called molly mcqueen .
the 30-year-old actress and producer flew to detroit from los angeles in december 2017 to learn how to drive the 2019 mustang bullitt and videotape chase scenes in dearborn for a debut film promoting the collector 's edition .
the audi owner had never driven a manual transmission until she was asked to be part of the top-secret launch .
`` i honestly did n't know how to drive a stick shift and i stalled it quite a few times .
by the end of the second day of shooting , they asked me to slow down .
it becomes second nature .
and you 're thinking about the gears and the clutch and driving becomes a fun activity as opposed to just a way to get from one place to another , '' molly told the free press in advance of sunday 's event at cobo center .
`` this is something my grandpa would have loved .
and my mother , terry mcqueen .
she used to always say , ` god , he would 've loved you .
you 're so similar to him . '
but i never knew my grandpa .
he died in 1980 and i was born in 1987 . ''
she continued , `` there were photos of him all around the house .
as i got older , i kind of started to realize that he was more than just my grandpa .
i 'm lucky enough to have this tableau of his life in movies .
i got to know him that way .
and now i 'm so excited about this project .
because it 's my most tangible connection to him . ''
few people know molly mcqueen is the famous actor 's granddaughter .
she grew up in pacific palisades with a film producer mother who spent most of her time at home as a mom .
now molly is a writer , actress and producer who recently sold her first project to warner bros. , the company that made her grandfather famous .
`` being here is something my grandpa would 've loved and appreciated , '' mcqueen said .
`` i do n't do a lot of mcqueen-related things .
but i love that a third-generation mcqueen is introducing the third-generation mustang bullitt .
it 's coming full circle . ''
mcqueen lifted the curtain on the 2019 mustang bullitt for the international news media on sunday afternoon at cobo center .
auto historians and collectors will be part of the ford display throughout the detroit auto show .
meanwhile , the 1968 mustang fastback , vin 8r02s125559 has been officially recorded as the 21st automobile on the national historic register .
a feature-length documentary is scheduled for a 2018 release .
according to the new jersey detective who sold the storied car to robert kiernan , then a 26-year-old insurance executive , he was the only person who responded to the ad that touted a steve mcqueen film connection `` with documentation . ''
the transaction was somewhere between $ 3,000-6,000 .
robbie kiernan , who had a 4-year-old daughter at the time , drove the bullitt mustang to st. vincent 's parish where she taught third grade .
her husband took a train to work in new york city .
`` in 1977 , my dad got a call from steve mcqueen , '' said sean kiernan , as recorded by the historic vehicle association archive .
`` steve tracked down the prior owner who gave him our phone number .
mcqueen wanted the car .
he was a guy that was not used to hearing the word ` no . '
but that 's what my dad told him ... the ` bullitt ' mustang was part of our family . ''
