tesla 's troubles manufacturing the model 3 are far from over , according to a top wall street firm .
goldman analyst david tamberrino reaffirmed his sell rating for tesla shares , predicting model 3 deliveries will come in below expectations .
`` we believe the company is tracking below its 2018 model s/x guidance of approx. 100k units -lrb- an implied 25,000 per quarter -rrb- .
further , while monthly model 3 deliveries are showing sequential improvement , we estimate that they will fall well short of consensus expectations , '' tamberrino wrote in a note to clients monday .
`` we continue to expect a slow ramp for the model 3 , and maintain our sell rating as we expect shares to de-rate as targets are potentially pushed further out . ''
tesla shares declined 2.4 percent monday .
tamberrino reaffirmed his first-quarter model 3 delivery estimate of 7,000 versus the wall street average of 13,800 after his analysis of vehicle registration data .
`` we maintain that the model 3 ramp will be below company expectations -lrb- albeit improved from model s/x ramps -rrb- , and note that incremental production issues may continue to appear as the company looks to ramp mass manufacturing along the chassis , body , and final assembly lines , '' he wrote .
the analyst reiterated his $ 205 six-month price target for telsa shares , representing 36 percent downside to friday 's close .
tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
