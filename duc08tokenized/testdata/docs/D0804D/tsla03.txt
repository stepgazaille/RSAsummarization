tesla shares skid into another bear market , and there 's more pain to come as the automaker enters a critical phase in its history , says one market watcher .
`` there 's been tons of pressure on the name in what many considered to be a make-or-break year for the company , '' michael bapis , partner and managing director at the bapis group at hightower advisors , told cnbc 's `` trading nation '' on monday .
tesla 's stock in tuesday trading was down nearly 21 percent from its 52-week high set on sept. 18 .
that level puts its shares in bear market territory having dropped more than 20 percent from its 52-week highs .
`` analyst consensus is negative , short interest is at such a high level , and people have been hurt by that , '' bapis said .
tesla is the most shorted stock in the nasdaq 100 at 22.8 percent of its float .
the second-highest short is sirius xm at 16 percent .
the ndx has average short interest of 3.4 percent .
goldman sachs on monday backed up its sell rating on the electric-car maker on forecasts that quarterly deliveries will fall short of estimates .
goldman analysts believe the company is tracking below model s and model x delivery guidance of around 100,000 units combined for the full year .
the firm predicts a soft first quarter and said that efforts to sell down inventories hit its fourth quarter .
its balance sheet is another concern to goldman sachs .
for the full year , goldman anticipates a loss of $ 9.23 a share , wider than the $ 6.15 loss expected by analysts surveyed by factset .
bapis is also weary of difficulties facing the company 's operations and finances .
`` the fundamentals are breaking down , '' he said .
`` we would stay away from the name .
we think it 's priced more for the consumer than the investor and i would look out below . ''
the stock 's charts also suggest trouble ahead to ari wald , head of technical analysis at oppenheimer .
`` the moderation in the trend is what 's most troubling for us , '' wald told `` trading nation '' on monday .
`` you can see the stock 's 200-day moving average starting to roll over .
that is indeed a cautionary signal . ''
its 200-day moving average was in an uptrend through the first three quarters of 2017 , but has plateaued between $ 320 and $ 340 since november .
its share price broke below the support level in mid-march after wavering above and below that line in the year so far .
`` the silver lining is that from a 30,000-foot view , big picture , the stock is still above its major breakout above $ 290 , '' said wald .
`` i think ultimately longer term it could work again but for now this is a no-touch . ''
tesla first broke above $ 290 in september 2014 but did not return to above that level until april 2017 .
the shares have held above that point since then .
monday 's loss was tesla 's fifth straight day in the red , a streak not seen since september .
it 's on track for a 9.5 percent monthly drop , its worst since july .
