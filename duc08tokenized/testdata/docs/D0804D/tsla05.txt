during a tweetstorm , elon musk has removed both of his companies ' facebook pages after being challenged to do so by a few of his followers .
the pages of both spacex and tesla are now inactive .
each had around 2.6 million followers .
musk was answering a flurry of tweets this morning when he responded to one from signal 's brian acton , co-founder of the facebook-owned whatsapp , that contained the hashtag #deletefacebook .
`` what 's facebook ? '' musk queried .
afterward , a follower told musk he should delete spacex 's facebook page if musk was `` the man . ''
musk claimed he did n't even know it existed and then said he would , probably in an attempt to preserve his `` the man '' status .
things ballooned from there .
after someone showed musk a screengrab of the spacex facebook page , he noted it was the first time he had seen it and that it would `` be gone soon . ''
then someone prompted him to delete tesla 's facebook page , with musk responding that it `` looks lame anyway . ''
and just for good measure , it seems that the facebook page for tesla-owned solar city has disappeared as well .
musk 's massive facebook troll comes on the heels of a particularly bad week for the social media company .
over the weekend , it was revealed that cambridge analytica , a consulting firm that worked on president trump 's election campaign , had improperly acquired data from 50 million facebook users .
the backlash has continued since then , with facebook users showing concern over the disregard for their privacy and government officials demanding answers .
despite the anti-facebook stance musk is taking , spacex and tesla are still alive on instagram , which is owned by facebook .
perhaps musk will shun that platform , too -- if he is the man .
