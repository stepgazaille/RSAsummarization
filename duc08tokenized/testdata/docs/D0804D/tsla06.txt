tesla has been instructed to `` slow down '' on car deliveries in norway this quarter , ceo elon musk said on saturday , in response to woes the company has experienced delivering their vehicles .
on twitter , musk replied to a report stating that tesla shipments in the country have been subject to accidents on the roads .
the publication , called electrek , said the car maker has had trouble finding `` competent transporters '' to deliver batches of cars , something a tesla representative said the company was working to address .
citing issues at the local level , and in order to preserve vehicle safety , musk said he requested that tesla 's unit `` slow down '' on car deliveries for the quarter .
norwegians are said to be major tesla enthusiasts , largely because electric vehicles are wildly popular in the country .
in fact , electric cars and hybrids accounted for more than half of new registrations in norway last year , boosted by generous government subsidies that encourage their use .
tesla dominates the electric vehicle market in the u.s. and in europe , according to data from jato dynamics .
tesla is putting pressure on premium car makers in europe , including mercedes benz , bmw and audi , to catch up on electric cars .
it was unclear which tesla models would be affected , or by how much deliveries in the country would be reduced .
a representative for the company did not immediately reply to cnbc 's request for comment .
tesla is experiencing significant challenges as it tries to move beyond high-end electric vehicles into the mass-market .
its future hinges on efficient , automated production of the model 3 sedan , which more than 400,000 people have already reserved , paying $ 1,000 refundable fees to do so .
musk said in july 2017 that tesla would probably be making 20,000 model 3s per month by december .
the company then later downgraded those expectations .
it currently says it will make 2,500 per week by the end of this month and 5,000 per week by the end of june .
