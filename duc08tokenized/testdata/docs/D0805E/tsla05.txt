tesla -lrb- tsla -rrb- stock fell tuesday , halting a seven-day run , after chief executive elon musk disclosed an alleged saboteur in the company 's ranks and warned short-sellers that their position was going to `` explode . ''
musk , in an email to staff late sunday and first reported by cnbc on monday , said an unnamed employee , who has since been caught , reportedly conducted `` extensive and damaging sabotage '' to company operations . '' .
this included `` exporting large amounts of highly sensitive data to unknown third parties . ''
according to the musk email , `` the full extent of his actions are not yet clear , but what he has admitted to so far is pretty bad , '' he wrote .
`` his stated motivation is that he wanted a promotion that he did not receive . ''
musk did not identify the person but said the investigation will continue in depth this week .
`` as you know , there are a long list of organizations that want tesla to die .
these include wall street short-sellers , who have already lost billions of dollars and stand to lose a lot more .
then there are the oil & gas companies , the wealthiest industry in the world â € '' they do n't love the idea of tesla advancing the progress of solar power & electric cars , '' he wrote .
tesla stock run .
tesla stock ended the day down 4.9 % , closing at 352.55 on the stock market today .
that halted a seven-day run to 370.83 . before tuesday 's decline , tesla shares were up 27 % since the company 's annual shareholder meeting on june 5 .
musk sent another email to employees on monday morning about a small factory fire on sunday night that halted production for several hours .
he suggested that employees look out for negligence or sabotage .
the tesla paint shop at its fremont , calif. , factory has had at least four fires since 2014 , according to cnbc .
musk also sent a tweet aimed at short-sellers , on sunday , giving them a warning .
`` they have about three weeks before this short position explodes , '' musk wrote .
the tweet was in response to a question that referenced short sellers being concerned about tesla 's recent manufacturing expansion .
the three-week time frame coincides with the end of the second quarter and would be about the time tesla typically reports quarterly vehicle deliveries .
a number above expectations could send shares soaring .
that would be bad news for short-sellers , who make money when the stock falls .
model 3 production .
musk is racing to double production of its critical model 3 sedan to 5,000 cars a week .
short sellers are skeptical the company can achieve that .
tesla stock received a price target increase two weeks ago by a wall street analyst who believes gross margins for the automaker 's model 3 will improve as it scales to higher production , thus helping it achieve profitability .
also potentially creating tension on the stock tuesday is the escalating trade war between the u.s. and china .
president donald trump has threatened tariffs on $ 250 billion worth of china goods .
that 's nearly double what china imports from the u.s. . but tesla could interrupt american business in china in other ways .
tesla is eager to significantly expand its business in china .
china could pose penalties such as customs delays , tax audits and increased regulatory scrutiny if trump delivers on his threat of bigger duties on chinese trade .
