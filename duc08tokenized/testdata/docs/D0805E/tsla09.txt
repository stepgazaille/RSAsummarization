what happened .
shares of electric-car company tesla -lrb- nasdaq : tsla -rrb- fell as much as 6.6 % on tuesday .
as of around 1:30 p.m. edt , the stock is down 4.8 % .
tesla stock 's decline comes amid a broader-market pullback on tuesday , particularly among many growth stocks .
at the time of this writing , the s&p 500 is down about 0.7 % and the nasdaq-100 is down about 0.9 % .
but there are likely other reasons behind tesla 's outsize decline on tuesday , namely news of a small fire at the company 's factory and an employee who attempted to `` sabotage '' tesla 's manufacturing operating system .
so what .
anything negatively impacting tesla 's production at this point is a reason for investors to be concerned .
the model 3 's production ramp-up is extremely important for the company right now as the automaker has said it wo n't be able to achieve profitability until it ramps up model 3 production to 5,000 units per week -- a target production rate tesla is aiming to hit by the end of june .
this is why investors may be uneasy after tesla ceo elon musk sent a company email in which he said that `` a tesla employee who had conducted quite extensive and damaging sabotage to our operations , '' according to a copy of the email obtained by cnbc .
the employee reportedly changed some code on the model 3 production line and even exported data to unknown third parties .
in another email , musk said there was `` another strange incident that was hard to explain . '' .
it was a small fire in the company 's `` body-in-white production line , '' musk said .
now what .
while musk is warning employees to stay alert about any suspicious activity , the ceo still seems optimistic about achieving tesla 's target production rate for model 3 .
`` looking forward to having a great week with you as we charge up the super exciting ramp to 5000 model 3 cars per week ! '' musk said in the email about the employee who sabotaged its manufacturing operating system .
the fire 's impact on tesla seems immaterial , as musk said there was no `` significant equipment damage '' and that the body production line was only paused for a few hours as a result of the fire .
