executive turnover at tesla inc. was a major theme in 2018 , and it 's continued into this year even as elon musk has turned a corner in other respects to running the electric-car maker .
dane butswinkas , who was brought on as general counsel in december after musk 's run-in with u.s. securities regulators , is leaving and returning full time to his trial practice at williams & connolly after just two months .
the culture of a white-shoe washington law firm and scrappy , california-based tesla are likely worlds apart , and musk is a notoriously demanding chief executive officer .
but turnover at tesla has become so common that the market reaction to the latest change in management was muted .
jonathan chang , a vice president in tesla 's legal department who has been at the company for almost eight years , is taking over effective immediately .
last month , in the final moments of the quarterly earnings call , musk announced that chief financial officer deepak ahuja was retiring .
musk has long expressed contempt for rigid reporting lines .
the company he has shaped in his image continues to prioritize nimbleness and flexibility over a clear chain of command , even as its workforce ballooned in recent years .
as of dec. 31 , tesla had 48,817 full-time employees , according to an annual regulatory filing .
in january , musk announced plans to cut 7 percent of the workforce .
tesla 's upper ranks include dozens of executives , most of whom never see the limelight -- and that 's by design .
aside from the charismatic boss , the company has always focused attention on products over the people who make them .
but an aversion to publicly disclosing a management team or even the names of its upper leadership is deeply unusual .
there 's no indication on tesla 's website of the people who hold major decision-making roles .
that 's not how it works at apple inc. , general motors co. or uber technologies inc. , all of which provide a list of key leaders .
the investor relations page of tesla 's website just lists three people , including ahuja .
in an effort to shed light on tesla executives who are n't named elon musk , bloomberg searched public references and interviewed several current and former employees to compile a list of key executives .
tesla is now nearly 16 years old , but many leaders on this list have been at the company fewer than five years .
these are the men and women that shareholders and customers are counting on to ramp up model 3 production , bring new vehicles to market and lead the world 's transformation from a mine-and-burn economy to a sustainable future .
