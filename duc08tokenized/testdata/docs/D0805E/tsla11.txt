electric car maker tesla 's move last week to cut 9 percent of its workforce will sharply downsize the residential solar business it bought two years ago in a controversial $ 2.6 billion deal , according to three internal company documents and seven current and former tesla solar employees .
the latest cuts to the division that was once solarcity -- a sales and installation company founded by two cousins of tesla ceo elon musk -- include closing about a dozen installation facilities , according to internal company documents , and ending a retail partnership with home depot that the current and former employees said generated about half of its sales .
about 60 installation facilities remain open , according to an internal company list reviewed by reuters .
an internal company email named 14 facilities slated for closure , but the other list included only 13 of those locations .
tesla declined to comment on which sites it planned to shut down , how many employees would lose their jobs or what percentage of the solar workforce they represent .
the company said that cuts to its overall energy team -- including batteries to store power -- were in line with the broader 9 percent staff cut .
`` we continue to expect that tesla 's solar and battery business will be the same size as automotive over the long term , '' the company said in a statement to reuters .
the operational closures , which have not been previously reported , raise new questions about the viability of cash-strapped tesla 's solar business and musk 's rationale for a merger he once called a `` no-brainer '' -- but some investors have panned as a bailout of an affiliated firm at the expense of tesla shareholders .
before the merger , musk had served as chairman of solarcity 's board of directors .
the installation offices that the internal email said were targeted for closure were located in california , maryland , new jersey , texas , new york , new hampshire , connecticut , arizona , and delaware .
the company also fired dozens of solar customer service staffers at call centers in nevada and utah , according to the former tesla employees , some of whom were terminated in last week 's cuts .
those employees spoke on condition of anonymity because making public comments could violate the terms of their severance packages .
`` it 's been a difficult few days -- no one can deny this , '' a tesla manager wrote in a separate internal email , sent to customer service employees shortly after the cuts were announced .
tesla has been burning through cash as it tries to hit a target of producing 5,000 model 3 electric sedans per week after production delays .
the company faces investor pressure to turn a profit without having to tap wall street for additional capital .
the total number of cuts to the solar workforce remained unclear .
some personnel at facilities closing down were being transferred to other sites , the current and former employees said .
solarcity employed about 15,000 people at the end of 2015 but has since cut thousands of workers .
ending the home depot partnership , which allowed for solar sales in about 800 stores , is part of tesla 's larger effort to absorb solarcity into its high-end brand and sell through 90 of its 109 u.s. retail stores and its website , the company said .
`` tesla stores have some of the highest foot traffic of any retail space in the country , '' tesla said .
analysts questioned tesla 's plans for the solar business in light of the latest cuts to staff and retail operations .
`` in effect , they seem to be saying , we have no strategy for selling solar , '' said frank gillett , an analyst at forrester research , adding that the solarcity purchase `` looks pretty awful right now . ''
falling sales
in the first quarter of this year , tesla installed 76 megawatts of solar systems - down from solarcity 's more than 200 mw a quarter in early 2016 , when it was the leading player in the industry .
in announcing quarterly results in february , tesla said growth in solar deployments would resume later this year .
tesla 's falling solar sales also could jeopardize the future of a joint venture with panasonic , announced as tesla moved to acquire solarcity in 2016 , to produce solar modules at a new factory in buffalo , new york .
tesla has an agreement with new york state requiring the company to spend $ 5 billion within 10 years .
if tesla fails to meet that obligation and others , the company may be required to pay tens of millions of dollars in penalties at various milestones , could lose its lease , or be forced to write down the assets , the company told investors in a may filing .
in response to questions from reuters , tesla said it is meeting its hiring and spending commitments for the factory .
in march , a delaware judge ruled against a tesla motion to dismiss a lawsuit by the company 's shareholders over the solarcity deal .
the lawsuit alleged tesla 's board of directors breached its duties to shareholders by approving the merger .
solarcity founder lyndon rive , who is musk 's first cousin and left tesla last year , did not respond to a request for comment .
high marketing costs
the move to end the longstanding home depot partnership blindsided many staffers because tesla had announced an expansion of the arrangement as recently as february .
gtm research analyst austin perea estimated the partnership has recently accounted for about half of sales , in part because of previous tesla moves to cut back on other sales and marketing costs .
such third-party retail partnerships are among the most expensive means of generating solar sales , according to the clean energy research firm , in part because retailers take a cut of each sale .
the cost of winning a customer through a store like home depot can be up to $ 7,000 per system , according to gtm research , compared with a national average of $ 4,000 per installation .
home depot spokesman stephen holmes said the retailer 's relationship with tesla would last through the end of the year , adding that home depot would continue a partnership with tesla competitor sunrun in an undisclosed number of stores .
over the past year , tesla has stepped up efforts to sell solar and batteries for energy storage in its retail stores , something musk said last year was `` a much more efficient channel for demand generation . ''
at the same time , tesla stopped door-to-door sales , once among solarcity 's most successful means of reaching new customers , and salespeople were no longer allowed to hold local events or buy online leads , the former employees said .
such tactics are standard practice across most of the competitive residential solar industry .
the home depot partnership was costly but also integral to tesla 's solar panel sales , a former employee told reuters .
`` it 's an expensive account , '' the former employee said , `` but it does bring in all the revenue . ''
