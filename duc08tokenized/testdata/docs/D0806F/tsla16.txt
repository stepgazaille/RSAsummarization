shares of tesla gave back all of the stock 's gains from earlier this week , as uncertainty starts to weigh on ceo elon musk 's hopes of taking the company private .
the stock lost 6 percent by midday trading thursday , falling below $ 346 before paring some losses to close at $ 352.45 .
that erases all gains prompted by a tweet on tuesday in which musk publicly floated the possibility of going private , sending shares up 11 percent .
musk claimed the necessary funding to take the company private had been secured , but that claim has drawn scrutiny and skepticism in the days since â € '' reportedly spurring inquiries from the sec .
the stock was down most of the day , and dipped more after a bloomberg report that the sec had been gathering information on tesla prior to tuesday .
the agency had been looking into tesla 's public statements on production numbers and sales targets , the news site reported , and intensified its scrutiny after tuesday 's tweet .
with thursday 's dip , tesla stock is up 13 percent in 2018 but flirting with correction territory , nearly 10 percent off its 52-week high .
