electric car maker nio filed plans on tuesday for an initial public offering on the new york stock exchange , just as rival tesla plans to exit the stock markets .
the two firms share some similarities , but there 's some key differences in their output that sets them apart .
nio is a china-based rival to tesla founded in november 2014 under the name nextcar , changing to its current name in july 2017 .
the chinese firm backed by big names like tencent and baidu plans to raise $ 1.8 billion in its initial offering .
it has a lot going for it , having made a name for itself in the world 's largest electric vehicle market where tesla has stumbled .
tesla is planning to change that with the shanghai gigafactory , but nio has a strong head start .
io 's electric cars
nio has produced two electric cars , showcased one concept vehicle , and plans another for future production .
the nio ep9 was introduced in october 2016 with a staggering top speed of 196 mph .
four separate motors and gearboxes helped earn it the accolade of world 's fastest electric vehicle .
it has a range of 256 miles , charging time of 45 minutes , and acceleration from 0 to 124 mph in 7.1 seconds .
it claimed a record autonomous driving time of 40.33 seconds around the circuit of the americas race track in austin , texas , in february 2017 , and a lap record of six minutes 45.9 seconds on germany 's legendary n√ºrburgring in may 2017 .
the es8 is the first volume manufactured vehicle , unveiled in december 2017 .
it 's a seven-seater aluminum vehicle that offers speeds of 0 to 60 mph in just 4.4 seconds , thanks to a drag coefficient of 0.29 .
the battery offers a new european driving cycle of 220 miles and total range of 310 miles .
the vehicle is available at a price of rmb 448,000 -lrb- $ 65,000 -rrb- before subsidies .
beyond these two , nio has also produced a concept car called eve that demonstrates the autonomous system 's future potential .
nio also plans to launch the five-seater es6 by the end of this year , with deliveries starting in the second half of next year , with a lower price than the es8 .
tesla vs nio . which is bigger ?
in terms of size , it 's almost no comparison .
nio only started shipping the es8 in june , and as of july 31 it had delivered 481 cars .
the company claims it has a backlog of 17,000 orders .
the firm made $ 6.9 million revenue at the end of june , but lost $ 502 million in the first half of this year and $ 759 million in the previous year .
tesla , on the other hand , is much larger .
in its second quarter ending in july , the company reported $ 4 billion in revenue and a total loss of $ 520 million .
in total , the firm has delivered over 360,000 vehicles , as highlighted in this recent chart :
tesla also claims to have around 400,000 reservations for its model 3 cheaper sedan , which starts at $ 35,000 .
this is alongside the $ 77,000 model s higher-end sedan and $ 83,000 model x sports utility vehicle .
tesla no longer produces the $ 108,000 roadster , its first electric vehicle that hit roads in 2008 .
the company has so far announced three new vehicles set to hit the roads over the coming years .
the model y is a cheaper sports utility vehicle , tentatively scheduled for an unveiling in march next year .
the $ 150,000 semi truck is an industry-focused vehicle that can run for 300 or 500 miles , set to hit roads next year .
the $ 200,000 second-generation roadster is a sporty followup to the company 's first car offers a staggering 0-60 mph speed of 1.9 seconds , and achieves a top speed of over 250 mph , set to hit roads in 2020 .
tesla vs. nio : how the business models differ
tesla 's model is relatively straightforward .
you go to the store or shop online , buy the car from tesla , and it 's yours .
tesla also offers financing options that space the cost out over many years .
tesla also offers charging through its proprietary supercharger network , with 1,327 stations offering 10,854 charging points worldwide , capable of offering 120 kilowatts to mostly charge a tesla in under half an hour .
nio is slightly different .
it offers mobile sales through an app , which doubles up as an online platform .
the firm also operates nio houses that act as both showrooms and clubhouses , aimed at fostering an online community and maintaining contact .
without tesla 's investments in infrastructure , nio has opted for a different approach to cut charging times .
its power swap service physically switches out the internal battery -- an approach dismissed by musk -- while a mobile charging service visits users to top their cars up if needed .
nio can also access china 's national charging network , 59.6 percent of which are classified as `` superchargers . ''
it 's hard to say how the next few years will play out , but it 's safe to say nio 's approach is intriguing to say the least .
