investors worry the company may not hit a key production milestone .
 publication , called electrek , said car maker has trouble finding `` competent transporters '' to deliver batches of cars , something a tesla representative said company was working to address .
 compensation is dependent on the company hitting certain milestones in the coming years .
 amount that would be more than 10 times the company 's current value of around $ 59 billion .
 but at some point if there 's somebody really spectacular inside or outside the company who would want to have that title and that role , that would be fine with me .
