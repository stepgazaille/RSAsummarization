u.s. supreme court struck down as unconstitutional law lets u.s. president strike out specific items in tax and spending measures .
 veto law unconstitutional last february , u.s. district judge thomas f. hogan says it amounted to surrender by congress of an `` inherently legislative function '' to the president . the line-item veto law was challenged by new york city and an idaho potato growers ' group after u.s. president bill clinton vetoed provisions they sought that were granted by congress .
 clinton was the first president to exercise a line-item veto , an authority sought by almost every president this century as a tool to limit wasteful politically based spending by congress . veto was provided to a democratic president by a republican congress .
 clinton : `` there is not a dime 's worth of difference '' between allowing the president to cancel a particular project .
 congress could overturn all or some of the line-item vetoes on a majority vote .
 if the president then vetoes that bill , it would require a two-thirds vote in a `` disapproval bill '' but if the president then vetoes that bill would require a two-thirds vote in both the house of representatives and senate to override .
 u.s. president bill clinton says he has not yet decided whether to strike out individual items in comprehensive tax and budget bills awaiting his signature .
 `` if there is to be a new procedure in which the president will play a different role in determining the text of what may become a law , '' stevens says .
 last month clinton used line-item authority , a power that can use to veto individual spending items in bills , to delete 38 projects in 24 states worth 287 million u.s. dollars from the fiscal 1998 military construction spending bill .
 the high court ruled the line item veto act violated the constitution 's separation of powers between congress .
 in a 6-3 decision , the president , who either signs it into law or vetoes it , approves legislation , and the president , who either signs it into law or vetoes it .
