A state appellate court today overturned the murder convictions of three former
executives in the work-related death of an employee exposed to cyanide on the
job .


The 1985 Cook County Circuit Court verdict against executives of Elk Grove
Village-based Film Recovery Systems Inc. was believed to be the first in which
corporate officials were convicted of murder charges in a job-related death .


The appellate court ruled that the convictions on charges of murder ,
involuntary manslaughter and reckless conduct were `` irreconcilable '' because of
the different mental states required for such findings , said defense attorney
Elliot Samuels .


`` The court has opened the door for a new prosecution , '' Samuels said .


Stefan Golab , 61 , a Polish immigrant who worked at the plant where cyanide was
used to recover silver from used X-ray film , collapsed at work after
complaining of dizziness and nausea in 1983 . His death was attributed to
cyanide poisoning from inhaling fumes on the job .
