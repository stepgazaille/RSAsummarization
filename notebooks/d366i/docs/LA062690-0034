The owner of a Burbank plating company who had pleaded guilty to 11 counts of
illegally storing and transporting cyanide-contaminated sludge was sentenced to
three years probation and ordered to pay more than $ 93,500 in fines , a Los
Angeles County investigator said Monday .


Larry Barker , owner of Artcraft Plating and Finishing Co. , was also ordered to
perform 200 hours of community service at his sentencing last week in Burbank
Municipal Court , said Marty Kasman , a deputy health officer with the county
Department of Health Services .


In exchange for his guilty pleas , the city of Burbank dropped 27 other charges
against him .


Investigators from the Department of Health Services had conducted
surveillances of the plating firm , dressed as undercover sanitation workers to
collect the firm 's garbage and put monitors in the sewers after company
officials refused entry to inspectors last year , Kasman said .


Cyanide was found in the sewer and in three trash bins when the firm was moving
last year from the 100 block of Verdugo Avenue to a new location on East Santa
Anita Avenue , Kasman said .


`` Our lab analysis showed this is probably the highest concentration of cyanide
we 've ever seen in a hazardous waste dumping case , '' Kasman said .


Barker said in a telephone interview Monday that `` we made some mistakes '' during
the move to the new plant , but that the relocation has enabled the company to
eliminate the use of cyanide and chrome in its plating work , replacing it with
a soaplike solution .


`` We do n't even have those chemicals anymore , '' Barker said .


Artcraft primarily does plating for military and aerospace contractors , Barker
said .
