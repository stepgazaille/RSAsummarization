Two brothers who operated a North Hollywood plating company were charged Friday
with recklessly handling and storing thousands of gallons of cyanide waste and
other hazardous materials , according to the Los Angeles County district
attorney 's office .


Cyanide was also dumped into the Los Angeles sewer system at the All-American
Plating Corp. in the 7100 block of Vineland Avenue , while open and unlabeled
tanks of acids were stored so close together that an accidental mixture could
have formed a toxic cloud , Deputy Dist . Atty. William W. Carter said .


`` If the cyanide had mixed with the other acid waste , you would have had a
similar reaction to what you have in a gas chamber , '' Carter said . `` An
inadvertent mixture of the two would have generated a cyanide cloud . ''


Carter said Yoav -LRB- Joe -RRB- Pantilant , 52 , of Woodland Hills , owner and president of
All-American Plating until it closed and was sold last month , was arrested
Friday morning while cleaning out his desk at the business . His brother , Sarv
-LRB- Tom -RRB- Pantilant , 45 , a general manager of the firm , was arrested at his Saugus
home .


Carter said the brothers each face one felony count of reckless handling and
storage of hazardous materials , seven misdemeanor counts of illegal storage of
hazardous materials and one misdemeanor count of illegally discharging into the
sewer system .


The Pantilants were the first suspects to face felony charges under a new state
law making it illegal to knowingly handle or store hazardous materials in a
reckless manner , Carter said .


The brothers could face up to three years in prison and $ 100,000 in fines if
convicted of the felony . They were being held at County Jail in lieu of
$ 250,000 bail each .


The company , which electroplated aircraft parts in a process that involved
placing them in large cyanide and acid baths , closed after the city of Los
Angeles cut off its sewer hookup and the district attorney 's office searched
the business , Carter said .


The investigation was initiated when employees told authorities about
conditions at the plant . The company had been convicted in 1987 of illegally
dumping cyanide into a dumpster and placed on three years probation and fined
$ 25,000 in a civil complaint case , Carter said . The fine was never paid , he
added .


On April 27 , investigators with a search warrant raided the plant , Carter said .


`` We caught them discharging cyanide into the sewer on the day we were there , ''
he said . `` You could smell cyanide in the air . ''


He said investigators found a storage room in the plant containing as much as a
two-year buildup of various acid wastes .


`` There were thousands of gallons in big tanks , open tanks , '' Carter said .
`` Nothing was labeled , and it was being handled and stored in such a way that it
was a risk . ''


On May 15 , the city cut off sewer service and the county Department of Health
Services began removing hazardous materials . The company will be charged for
the cleanup , Carter said .


Though closed down , the business apparently was sold to a Mexican company in
June , Carter said .


Attorneys for the Pantilants could not be reached for comment Friday .
