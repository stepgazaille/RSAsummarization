Up in the Antelope Valley , the day dawns hot but humid , the kind of summer day
firefighters like . Before 8 a.m. , Scott Graham is at the wheel of his white
Jeep -- the one with the PARADOK license plates -- headed for Station 111 in
Saugus .


At the firehouse , there will be housekeeping chores . This day is hose day .
Great loops of fire hose drying on the tower must be rolled and stored . The
kitchen floor and cabinets must be scrubbed .


In a few hours , the other firefighters will want lunch . And Graham is the cook
today .


On another hot , sticky day , at Station 66 in South-Central Los Angeles , Rick
Paiz and the other firefighters report for morning lineup . Seated at long
kitchen tables , they hear Capt. Steven Ventura 's announcements -- about new
coveralls , about an upcoming swap meet and a retirement dinner .


A voice crackles over the PA system . Fire . Within minutes , firefighters have
pulled on their `` turnouts '' -- 75 pounds of fire-resistant gear -- and are
speeding to the scene , a vacant house on South Harvard Boulevard . Riding high
on the rear of truck 66 is Paiz , the tiller man .


In Southern California , late summer and fall are fire season , when parched
brush land and careless campers or crazed arsonists can combine disastrously .
For firefighters -- the 2,700 men and women who wear the badge of the city and
the 2,200 who are uniformed members of the county Fire Department -- brush
fires are just another hazard of the job .


Routinely , they deal with danger and tragedy . Drownings and shootings . Heart
attacks and overdoses . Structural fires and traffic accidents .


They are a fraternity , men and women who share a unique life style , a
commitment that is extraordinary and traditions that die hard . To a large
extent , they do it for love , not money . Entry-level pay is above $ 30,000 a
year ; journeyman firefighters earn more than $ 40,000 , captains $ 60,000-plus .
And firefighters can double their pay working overtime .


Rick Paiz , 33 , is a firefighter assigned to Station 66 on Slauson Avenue in the
heart of Los Angeles . Scott Graham , 32 , is a county firefighter-paramedic ,
based at Station 111 in rural Saugus . Here 's a day in the life of each .


Early on a Saturday at Station 111 , Capt. Harry Thy , who has 21 years with the
department , looks out the window to the dry hills of the Antelope Valley and
muses about the chances of another blaze like the Bouquet Canyon fire that
blackened 1,000 acres a week before . `` That guy likes to start fires on
Saturdays , '' he says .


So far this year , the 111 crew -- a regular complement per shift of six
firefighters , an engine , a paramedic squad car and a patrol car , plus an engine
and three men temporarily assigned while a new fire station is being built --
has responded to 1,700 calls , only 20 % of them fires .


Most are traffic accidents and medical emergencies . Some are tragic , some
bizarre . There are limits . `` We do n't generally do cats in trees , '' Thy says ,
asking , `` Have you ever seen a cat skeleton in a tree ? ''


He is saying , `` It 's been a tough week '' for the men of 111 . Two traffic
fatalities . And two dead children -- a toddler who ingested diaper rash
medication and a little girl whose skull was crushed by a falling fireplace
mantle .


`` Those are the hardest ones , especially for those of us who have small
children , '' says Dave Enriquez , who at 25 is the `` baby '' of this crew .


It is 10 o'clock and already Graham fields questions about lunch . He has
decided on pasta salad . This younger generation of firefighters is more
health-conscious . Besides , he says , a heavy meal is not always compatible with
911 calls .


En route to the supermarket , a motorist flags him down to report a `` really bad
accident . '' He radios the station , then speeds to the scene , where a maroon
Dodge Omni has jumped the divider and collided with a white Nissan Sentra .


`` Hi , anybody hurt ? '' he asks the Omni 's driver , a stout woman in shorts . `` Well ,
I 've got a terrible headache , '' she says .


In the Sentra 's front seat , the other driver , a Latino man , appears dazed . He
insists he 's unhurt . Graham shrugs . `` They always say they have no problem
because they 're not quite legal . '' He is worried about the way the man looks ;
still , he ca n't force him to go to a hospital .


The paramedics take over . Graham heads for the grocery , where there 's a special
on mahi-mahi filets . That will be dinner , along with fresh broccoli and rice .
Sometimes shopping is cut short by an alarm ; he 'll just ask a clerk to `` stick
it all in the freezer '' until he gets back .


Graham has seven years with the department , 3Â 1/2 of them at Station 111 , which
handles 100 square miles . Previously , he was a civilian ambulance paramedic .
Eventually , he hopes to `` promote , '' which means moving to another station ,
gaining new experience . But for now , he 's `` having too much fun '' at 111 .


Up here , they talk about Los Angeles as `` down below , '' where violence and drugs
are rampant , where the only doctor many people know is the Fire Department . In
the Antelope Valley , people still look out for neighbors and know what their
kids do .


But up here , long , open stretches of road and drinking drivers are a lethal
combination . Firefighters figure the odds of encountering a drinking driver on
the highway : 1-in-4 at midnight ; 1-in-3 at 1 a.m. ; 1-in-2 at 2 a.m. .


This day , Graham stops by the ICU at Henry Mayo Memorial Newhall Hospital to
see a man he brought to the emergency room early the day before : Drunk driver ,
22 . Hit a telephone pole . No seat belt . Thrown from vehicle .


If he lives , the man will be a vegetable . Cases like this would make anyone ask
who chooses to be a firefighter . It 's a question Thy asks himself : `` What kind
of person likes to go into a burning building , or dip his arms into blood and
body parts up to his elbows ? '' But he knows the answer : `` Maybe we never grew up .
It provides excitement in our lives . ''


Firefighters have seen it all , yet it still gets to them . Graham will never
forget `` the guy who drove his car up one of these canyons , poured gasoline on
it , set the car on fire and got in . '' The man , horribly burned , kept screaming ,
`` Why did you stop me ? '' He died the next day .


And there was `` the hardest run I ever had , '' Graham 's first time having to tell
a family that their son had just been killed in his overturned pickup .


Graham , tall and slender with tinted glasses , styled gray hair and mustache , is
a PR man 's dream firefighter . He has been married for six years to Cindy , his
former dental hygienist . They have three sons . Off-duty , he is a Pop Warner
Football coach . His idea of a vacation is fishing with other firefighter
families .


He is a department cheerleader : `` I love the job , much as I complain about
dragging hoses up hills . '' He still shudders when remembering a high school job
in a windowless room in a North Hollywood factory : `` I went absolutely bonkers .
I promised myself I would never , ever , ever work indoors again . ''


But Graham , sooner or later , will `` go below '' to Los Angeles to learn more about
structural fires , to promote to engineer and `` eventually , down the road , become
a captain . ''


This life can be hours of monotony punctuated by moments of stress . A
firefighter 's basic day at the office is 24 hours , with catnaps in the dorm
between alarms .


Firefighters sleep `` like there 's a baby in the house , '' says John Harm , who
figures he has `` homesteaded '' at 111 . He came to the station in 1973 and plans
to stay until he retires in seven years with 30 years .


Because firefighters may work 72 hours straight -- trading time with a buddy or
volunteering for overtime -LRB- at time and a half -RRB- -- the station is a second home ,
the crew a second family . In their 11-day labor cycles , they average 96 hours
work ; typically it 's 24 hours on , 24 off , 48 hours on , 48 off , 24 hours on , 96
hours off .


For the men of 111 -LRB- there are no women there now -RRB- , the heart of this second
home is a multipurpose room with six slightly tattered brown tweed lounger
chairs , a giant-screen TV the men bought themselves , a long dining table and a
homey kitchen with microwave and dishwasher .


Cooking is shared and rotated . Washing dishes is another matter . After meals ,
playing cards come out .


`` We 're not looking for a winner , '' engineer Robert Sklar explains . `` We 're
looking for a loser '' -- the guy who washes the dishes .


The dealer calls the game , which may be named for a fire captain shot by his
wife or for a firefighter who lost his thumb when a fire hose got wrapped
around it . For firefighters , black humor is a coping mechanism .


In the games , bidding is brisk for the extra hand -- 25 cents , 50 cents . Thy
counts the money in the can -- $ 120 . It buys little luxuries for the station .
The basics -- condiments , cable TV , newspaper subscriptions -- are paid for
with house dues , $ 1.50 a day , $ 1.75 on overtime . Breakfast and dinner are $ 3
each .


This is an atypically quiet afternoon , time for reading and playing cards .
About 5 o'clock , Graham lights the barbecue .


But before dinner , there 's one false alarm vehicle accident ; one call to aid a
42-year-old severe asthmatic in Saugus .


The other crew , Engine 73 , returns from a rescue call . A boy , 4 , with a
cigarette lighter had set his baby sister 's playpen on fire .


The scream of sirens causes suburbanites to rush to their front doors to gawk .
Kids , flushed with excitement , ask , `` Is there a fire ?! '' They are disappointed
to learn that someone has fainted , that there has been a fender-bender .


But this is the stuff of firefighters ' days .


Back at the station , 9 p.m. . The dinner dishes are done . Harm dashes to the
7-Eleven to get a list of winning Lotto numbers . He recalls the prank , now
legend , pulled on one firefighter , a setup in which his friends recorded
`` winning '' numbers on an answering machine at his station , then bought him a
ticket with the numbers . Convinced he was an instant millionaire , he told his
captain what he could do with the job .


The man is still a firefighter .


It is quiet , very quiet . The men joke about staying up until 11 to please the
`` run gods , '' who may then grant them an uninterrupted night 's sleep .


About 1:30 , two hours after everyone turns in , the dong-ding for 111 sounds --
a fire on the logjammer ride at Six Flags Magic Mountain . But the call is
canceled before the rig leaves the station .


The next call comes in close to 4 a.m. . In a small apartment strewn with toys
and dirty dishes , a very pregnant woman is in distress , chest pain . She thought
it was heartburn -- she had spaghetti for dinner -- but Maalox only made it
worse . An ambulance takes her to emergency ; the firefighters return to the
station . Later , the woman will be sent home .


At 4:15 a.m. , over the PA comes a rescue call . A woman , 22 , complaining of
abdominal pain . `` When did this come on ? '' Graham asks her . The day before , she
tells him . The flu , probably . He manages to remain sympathetic .


Around 6:30 a.m. , a new day begins . The coffee pot is on . A new shift reports .
But Graham stays 24 hours more .


At lineup , the new captain tells firefighters that AZT may be made available to
firefighter-paramedics at high risk through accidental exposure to AIDS . The
disease `` is a concern , '' as is hepatitis , Graham says later . He wears latex
gloves and other protective gear but does n't dwell on danger . `` You 're either
going to get it or you wo n't . You do what you can . ''


As the bacon and pancakes are about to be served , there is a rescue call : a
woman , 34 , who thinks she may have had a stroke -- `` My whole left side is
fuzzy . '' Graham takes her left hand and tells her , `` Squeeze real tight , kiddo .
. . nothing to be scared about , everything 's working fine . '' Still , he has
detected a slight weakness in one leg . The squad follows an ambulance to the
hospital .


Before brunch , there will be two more rescues , an assist on a 4-year-old burn
victim who will be airlifted from Castaic Lake by Fire Department helicopter .
Then it 's the televised Dodgers-Pirates game and funny car races until 3 p.m.
when the squad responds to a Magic Mountain call on a woman in line who has
passed out because of the oppressive heat .


At day 's end , Graham shakes his head . `` In two years , '' he says , `` I have n't
worked a day on the engine when we have n't had a brush fire . '' He attributes it
to his visitors , ride-alongs observing his shift . Always happens with
ride-alongs , he says .


`` Down below , '' at Station 66 , they 're talking about a recent shoot-out -- two
men driving side-by-side down the street , firing at each other .


They 're talking , too , about the man who drove a car through the door of their
garage on July 3 , coming to a stop about an inch from a fire engine .


Capt. Steve Ventura , on duty that day , recalls : `` I heard the gunshots and I
heard someone scream , ` My buddy 's been shot . ' '' As he watched , the passenger in
a passing car spotted a fire station , and , grabbing the wheel from the wounded
driver , steered for the station . Unfortunately , he had no brake control .


The five square miles covered by Station 66 is rife with violence , poverty and
urban blight . Firefighter Tom Scyphers , who 's spent seven years at this
station , says , `` We 've seen the ugliest rapes , the ugliest shootings , people
with their heads blown off . You squeeze in a fire now and then , too . ''


Rick Paiz is one of 12 firefighters working this 24-hour shift . A firefighter
for 11 years , he has spent 10 years at Station 66 , by choice . He likes a busy
house . `` You hate to talk about someone 's misfortune as something good for
yourself , '' he says , but when there are fires `` you feel like you 're earning your
pay . ''


This morning , he wo n't have to wait long to earn it . Soon after 10 , he is on
the roof of a house where a fire appears to have started in the attic . He helps
chop a hole for ventilation , stripping dry shingles that are like kindling ,
searching for hot spots beneath .


The house , vacant for eight years , was purchased recently and was in escrow .
The new owner , summoned to the scene , looks on in shock . Her beautiful hardwood
floors are flooded -- `` The only thing I did n't have to fix . ''


The flames doused , the firefighters , dripping with perspiration , relax for a
moment . `` I 'll buy you a drink , '' one tells another . Both take a paper cup of
water .


It was a typical house fire , says Ventura , `` Ten minutes of firefighting , an
hour of cleanup . ''


By 11:30 , they are back at the station . At noon , Rick Ramirez , today 's
firefighter-cook , is on the PA. `` Come and get it ! '' There are cheeseburgers ,
canned peaches in the can , cottage cheese in the carton , tortilla chips in the
bag . No time here for formalities .


Over lunch , Capt. Lee Weber talks about drug labs in the area served by Station
66 . `` I 've found five-gallon cans of used ether in an alley in back of
somebody 's house , '' an ingredient for making PCP , Weber says , adding , `` They also
use cyanide . That 's what they use in the gas chamber . ''


Lethal gases are only one concern . Weber recalls a recent house fire when
firefighters found a man inside , still asleep . `` The guy was scared and pulled a
gun from beneath his pillow . ''


Weber is a former construction worker , who at 41 has 13 years in the
department . `` About a month ago , I went on a skateboard-by shooting , '' Weber
says . '' We 've had bicycle-by shootings . ''


But possibly the biggest hazard firefighters face is driving to the scene .
`` Especially now , '' Weber says . `` People are driving with their air conditioning
on and the stereo up . They do n't hear us . ''


Weber , who is married to a teacher , says , `` It takes a very special person to be
married to a firefighter ... . Dad 's gone . Mom may say , ` You wait till Dad
comes home . ' Well , Dad may not come home till the next morning and Dad may be
real cranky because he had to get up in the middle of the night . ''


He adds , `` There are a lot of single firemen . ''


Paiz was recently married , to Laura , who `` works normal hours , '' he says . `` It was
tough at first . She was scared at night . Hopefully , she 'll get used to it . ''


He is happy at Station 66 but knows , `` Now that I 'm getting older , it 's time to
move on . '' He hopes to make captain . Above that , he says , `` It gets political . I
do n't see myself doing that . But then , when I started this job , I did n't see
myself being anything but a firefighter . I was having too much fun . ''


Paiz figures he 's in it for the duration , 30 years . It 's a dangerous job ; he
loves it .


When he describes big fires he has fought , the first that comes to mind is a
Ralphs market in the San Fernando Valley , where the roof caved in . He recalls
it as `` a big red wave turned upside down on top of your head . ''


Sometimes , inside a fire , Paiz says , `` You start to get claustrophobic . You talk
to yourself , saying ` Calm down , do n't breathe too heavy . ' ''


Being a firefighter is not always the TV drama-type dream . `` I 've never run into
a burning building and pulled somebody out , '' Paiz says . `` I have gone into a
burning house where there were still people inside . Usually , they were already
dead . ''


Paiz 's home away from home , Station 66 , is new , a replacement for the
61-year-old Florence Avenue facility that was condemned because it was not
earthquake-proof . Central air conditioning is one new perk ; bedrooms in place
of a single dorm are another . But the jury is still out on that one ; some
firefighters miss the togetherness .


Since the early-morning fire , things have been monotonously quiet at Station
66 . At 6:30 , Rick Ramirez , today 's cook , announces over the PA , `` OK , the moment
you 've all been dreading . Dinner ! '' It is Mexican stew , with frijoles , rice and
tortillas .


Just as everyone digs in , the engine company gets a call . Mop-up help is needed
at a Griffith Park brush fire ; soon after , in South-Central , the truck --
Paiz 's detail -- handles an accident , a Suzuki motorcycle and car collision .


Back at the station , there is dinner to be finished , and a surfing competition
on TV . Then , while it is still daylight , Ventura takes the truck company to a
site at 64th Street and West Boulevard , a condemned property where there have
been several recent arson fires . Then , the crew responds to a house in
Inglewood where hot wires have been blown down .


Last Friday , firefighters helped put out a blaze at the 2nd A. M. E. Church
Church on Hoover and 55th streets . This day , they return to inspect the church
where there are fire-fighting lessons to be learned . In the vestibule , a huge
chandelier lies on the tile floor . It fell on a firefighter during the blaze ;
luckily , it struck his compressed air tank .


Today and tonight , there will be no more fires . Since the mid - '70s , fires have
been fewer . Some attribute that to smoke detectors , to education , to an influx
of ethnic groups who do not call firefighters because they think they will have
to pay and are embarrassed to seek help .


The engine crew , which includes one woman , Mary Kay Intyre , a policewoman
turned firefighter , returns before midnight from Griffith Park .


Paiz and the others , all but the paramedics , get an uninterrupted night 's
sleep , a rarity at Station 66 .


It never fails , Ventura says , when there are ride-alongs .
