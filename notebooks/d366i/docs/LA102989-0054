When tragedy tore Linda Link 's life apart , she struggled with anguish , then
anger . Finally , she turned her emotions into action .


She took up the fight for worker safety . It is little solace for the loss of
her son , Jeff , who died in an accident on the job , but she is devoted to the
cause . So are her comrades who share her sorrow .


One is Edna Freeze . Her son , Bill , died trying to save Jeff .


And there is Bob Hensinger . His son , Larry , was also killed in the rescue
attempt .


And Sue Irish 's son , Barney , died when he rushed to help the others .


And Brenda Fogle . Her son , Craig , the last man to come to the others ' aid , also
died . After two days in a coma , his respirator was turned off .


Five families buried sons , their futures unfulfilled . Now , more than a year
after the young men -- ages 19 to 29 -- succumbed to toxic fumes at Bastian
Plating Co. , their parents are writing letters , calling lawmakers , rallying --
and pleading , `` Never again . ''


`` If we can do any good , it gives us the satisfaction to know that the boys
did n't die in vain , '' Link said . `` We ca n't bring them back , but in their name ,
we can maybe help make it so these things do n't happen ever again . And it gives
us something to think about other than the tragedy . ''


`` You 're hoping you 'll change things ... you 'll get people to listen , ''
Hensinger said . `` It 's always worth a try . Only a fool sits back and does
nothing . ''


The families ' demands are modest . No sweeping changes . Just a little more
caution and a lot more accountability from employers .


`` Even if one factory would be really safe , that would make us feel good , ''
Freeze said .


The campaigners were brought together by the June 28 , 1988 , tragedy at Bastian ,
where Jeff was overcome by hydrogen cyanide fumes while cleaning a holding
tank . Bill , a plant worker for only four weeks , and Larry , climbed in to help ,
investigators were told .


Barney , once Bill 's schoolmate , valiantly tried to save them , according to
accounts . Then Craig , the last rescuer , slid down the side of the tank and
struck his head , his mother said .


The workers did not know there was zinc cyanide residue in the tank , said David
Bear of the Indiana Occupational Safety and Health Administration . Muriatic
acid , a dilute form of hydrochloric acid , was the cleaning agent , he said , and
the mixture produced the toxic gas .


Indiana OSHA fined Bastian $ 41,700 , claiming that it had not provided adequate
training , respirators or rescue equipment -- such as a lifeline for pulling the
workers out of the tank . It also had not conducted air tests in the tank before
anyone entered it .


Bastian has contested the `` knowing '' violations and paid the remainder of fines
that total $ 1,700 . It has refused to comment since it released a statement
shortly after the accident saying : `` We are sorry that it took a tragedy of
these proportions to focus attention on the issue of industrial safety . ''


The parents say they knew their sons ' job could be hazardous ; they came home
with burns on their arms and legs . Larry once told his ex-wife , '' ` If I do n't
get out , the job 's going to kill me , ' '' his father said . `` I took it as a figure
of speech . ''


After the accident , the families said Bastian made a terrible situation worse
by not telling them how it had happened .


`` We need answers , '' Irish said . `` A lot of them . ''


A worker safety watchdog group asked DeKalb County Prosecutor Monte Brown to
convene a grand jury probe of the accident , but he refused to comment pending a
report from the state Department of Environmental Management .


`` Five guys went to work and expected to return home , '' said Bill Groth , a leader
of the watchdog group . `` They did n't . Something went drastically wrong . ''


Their families are frustrated , he added . `` They want to know why there was a
delay in calling the ambulances ... . They ca n't find out what happened to
their sons . ''


With Groth 's guidance , the families began meeting with consumer groups , talking
with reporters and lobbying for stronger OSHA enforcement , changes in worker
compensation laws and measures to allow injured employees to sue employers who
remove cautionary warnings or safety devices from machines .


`` It 's a good catharsis for them , '' Groth said . `` We 've encouraged them to channel
emotions in a positive way , through political action . ''


They also consulted a lawyer , Mike Kendall , about legal action , but with few
exceptions , workers ' compensation is the exclusive remedy for on-the-job
accidents .


Kendall said the families have been `` radicalized '' by the tragedy .


At the same time , they have learned a hard lesson in civics , discovering that
government moves slowly and its agencies are hamstrung by rules , laws and
dollars .


`` I always thought OSHA inspected every place every year , '' Freeze said . `` They
do n't have the money or the inspectors to do everything ... . It 's going to
have to be the employer that 's going to have to look out for his employees . ''


`` You get so many slaps in the face , all the things you find out , '' Link said .


Workers ' compensation , for one .


Because Jeff was single , `` all we got was $ 2,000 for funeral expenses , '' Link
said . `` They do n't give you any compensation ... for the love you lost ...
not that any amount of money can bring him back . ''


Together , the families took flowers to the graves on the first anniversary of
the accident . It helped , but anger remains .


`` They had their whole lives ahead of them . None of them were married , '' Fogle
said . `` You have so many hopes and dreams for your children . You never think
you 're going to have to bury your children . ''
