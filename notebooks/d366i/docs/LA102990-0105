About 9 million gallons of potentially hazardous sodium cyanide spilled Sunday
from a reservoir into a nearby creek when a dam broke , authorities said .


The spill posed little threat to drinking supplies , but officials warned
residents to keep animals from tainted water .


The substance , a poisonous chemical when undiluted , spilled from a reservoir at
Brewer Gold Co. when a dam broke , said Richard Carnes , emergency preparedness
director in Chesterfield County .


Heavy rain might have weakened the dam along the reservoir . Sodium cyanide
spilled into Little Fork Creek , about 2,000 feet from the reservoir . The creek
flows into Lynches River , about two miles from the spill .


The company uses the chemical to separate gold from ore .


Georgetown , about 110 miles southeast of Jefferson , is the nearest municipality
to draw drinking water from the lake system .


`` We really feel like by the time it gets that far it will be hard to even
detect , '' said Thom Berry , spokesman for the state Department of Health and
Environmental Control .


The reservoir held 13 million to 14 million gallons of sodium cyanide , Berry
said . He said leaking continued late Sunday .


Results of water quality tests would not be available until today .


Consumption of undiluted sodium cyanide can be fatal , but it is significantly
weakened when mixed with water , Berry said .
