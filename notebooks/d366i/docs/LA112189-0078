If there is a golden rule of nutrition , it is a simple one : Too much of
anything is bad for you .


Yet , when it comes to amino-acid nutritional supplements , Americans seem to
cling more to the creed that if a substance occurs naturally within the human
body , one can never have too much of it .


That philosophy resulted in the development of an estimated $ 150-million-a-year
market for the amino acid tryptophan in the United States over the last few
years . Sold over the counter merely as a `` nutritional supplement , '' it
nonetheless has been used as an alternative drug by many people , sometimes on
the advice of physicians .


The tryptophan boom was stopped cold last week by state and federal orders
banning sales of tryptophan while officials determine whether the substance is
behind 287 U.S. cases of a rare blood disorder , 24 of them in California .


If tryptophan supplements are indeed responsible for the outbreak of
eosinophilia , contamination is a key suspected cause . However , because
tryptophan has a complicated metabolic pathway in the body , there is also the
possibility that excessive doses could have built up one or more byproducts to
harmful levels , scientists say . Tryptophan advocates , who point to years of use
of the amino acid , say they think an obscure virus is at fault for the outbreak
of the blood disorder .


Whether or not the amino acid really is to blame , the situation highlights the
rise in a quasi-medical underground that sees amino acid supplements as a
`` natural '' way to remedy a host of ills .


Ca n't sleep well ? Eating too much ? Depressed ? Suffering premenstrual syndrome ?
Try tryptophan , popular books advise .


In training ? Try arginine or ornithine to stimulate a `` natural '' steroid dose in
your body that will bulk up muscles , the athletes ' grapevine says .


Or replenish your protein stores with leucine , isoleucine , valine and
threonine , the grapevine also says .


But critics say the scientific research on which this type of advice is based
is preliminary at best . More importantly , it was never followed up with the
kinds of careful studies that would determine how much of these amino acids is
enough -- and how much is too much .


Consequently , critics express doubts about the usefulness of amino acid testing
and therapy done in Southern California and elsewhere . In some cases , they
suggest , amino acid supplementation could be dangerous .


But psychiatrist Priscilla Slagle says she uses `` a wide variety '' of amino acids
to treat her patients in Los Angeles , Encino and Palm Springs . Among them have
been `` hundreds '' of people given tryptophan .


`` I do believe that amino acid treatment is a frontier treatment , and I believe
they do have powerful medical uses , '' Slagle said . `` When people have illnesses
and difficulties , their metabolic processes are disturbed . So we 're talking
about correcting and creating a balance again . ''


Because she has concerns about quality control , Slagle tells her patients to
use only products formulated by Tyson & Associates of Santa Monica , which
markets its amino acids only through doctors .


Don Tyson , president of the firm , said it does about $ 5 million a year in
business through `` a few hundred '' doctors in the Los Angeles area and `` a few
thousand '' throughout the United States and in Holland , Italy and Belgium .


But the vast majority of tryptophan and other amino acid supplements consumed
by Americans comes not from firms that market through doctors but from
manufacturers that sell through retail outlets . These manufacturers count on
popular health books and word of mouth to build a clientele .


Because amino acid pills are classified as nutritional supplements , the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration has no controls over their manufacture or sale .


Scientists and mainstream physicians have viewed the amino acid boom as
relatively harmless , since they assume Americans taking the supplements are
adequately nourished .


But for a marginally nourished or malnourished person , they suggest , amino acid
supplements might be harmful . Animal research shows that , when an animal is
getting barely enough of the amino acids it needs , giving it a high dose
produces illness much more readily than in a well-nourished animal , said
Dorothy Gietzen , a biochemist who directs the UC Davis psychiatry research lab .


In addition , some scientists worry about damage to the liver from having to
break down unused amino acids and possible damage from accumulation of
byproducts of the breakdown .


In the elegant chemical factory that is life , there are four major components :


* The genetic code provides a blueprint for all work the body does .


* Carbohydrates provide energy to do the work .


* Proteins direct the work .


* Fats store energy for use later .


Twenty-two different amino acids are known as building blocks in the protein
division of this biochemical factory . Just as a child snaps together Legos to
build a thousand fantastic structures , the body strings together amino acids in
countless ways to make countless proteins .


-LRB- Amino acids come in L and D forms -- the L form being the version that the
body naturally uses and the version most commonly sold . The D form is a
three-dimensional mirror image . -RRB-


When a human lifts a finger , has a thought , or just breathes , it is because
enzymes and other proteins are causing chemical reactions to make this use of
energy possible .


But the raw material for this comes only from taking in proteins in food ,
breaking them down in the gastrointestinal tract , and then absorbing the
resulting amino acids into the bloodstream . Unused amino acids are broken down
by the liver .


The body needs all 22 amino acids to work properly , and a deficiency in any one
of them becomes the limiting factor for protein synthesis . However , in adults
only eight `` essential '' amino acids -- including tryptophan -- must be derived
from food . The other 14 important amino acids can be synthesized adequately by
the body from the essential amino acids . -LRB- Babies need histidine but develop the
ability to synthesize it as they grow . -RRB-


Over short periods , the body harmlessly makes up for shortages of essential
amino acids by digesting protein-rich muscle cells of its own gastrointestinal
tract . Over long periods or in a marginally nourished person , deficiency
results in disease , such as pellagra , caused by lack of vitamin B-6 , which is
produced when the body breaks down tryptophan .


Where advocates of amino acid supplements and their critics disagree is in
whether it is useful or harmful to try to boost the protein-building process by
taking amino acid supplements .


Tyson , of the Santa Monica amino acid firm , says keeping track of his amino
acid levels and augmenting them keeps him from getting sick .


Slagle and her patients say adding tryptophan to their daily health care
rituals helps them sleep better and cures depression .


Tryptophan is thought to do this by boosting the brain 's level of the chemical
serotonin .


But the same effect can be gotten at less expense and with less risk of
overloading the body by merely drinking a glass of milk at bedtime , said
Richard Wurtman , a Massachusetts Institute of Technology researcher whose work
showing the serotonin link helped popularize tryptophan .


Wurtman said he worries that the unregulated use of tryptophan means people are
overloading their bodies with it and are doing so without knowing basic
precautions . It will amplify the effects of certain antidepressant ,
hypertensive or antipsychotic drugs , and should never be taken before driving
or dangerous activities , he noted .


Tryptophan 's perceived status as a nutritional good guy provides an interesting
contrast to the negative image of a sister amino acid , the flavor enhancer
monosodium glutamate .


The `` glutamate '' part of MSG is an amino acid and , like tryptophan , is a
neurotransmitter , affecting the delicate cells of the brain and nervous system .
It is excesses of glutamate that are blamed for that lethargic , headachy
condition often called Chinese restaurant syndrome .


Yet the same people who worry that a Chinese restaurant is using MSG might go
home at night and pop a tryptophan pill to help them sleep .


Part of the difficulty in determining whether amino acid supplements are good
or bad is that their various paths through the body and interactions with one
another are complicated and , so far , not very well studied .


`` The point is we know very little about what happens in terms of flows of
material in the body , especially for amino acids like tryptophan , '' said Dwight
Matthews , associate professor at Cornell Medical College in New York City .
Matthews tacks radioactive atoms onto amino acids and then traces their
biological paths .


`` You can go back to almost any eating studies and look at how amino acid levels
change after a meal , but there 's not a lot in terms of the kinetics -- what
happens to it later , '' Matthews said .


At UC Davis , biochemist Gietzen noted that studies of rats show that
concentrations of amino acids in blood vary widely depending on whether the
animal has been fasting or has just eaten , the composition of the most recent
meal , and the time of day .


Citing a paper she uses as a reference , Gietzen said there are wide variations
in amino acid levels in plasma that are considered average . For tryptophan , the
average range in men is from 30 to 90 nanograms per milliliter of plasma ; for
women , it ranges from 24 to 76 .


With that wide a range , how can `` normal '' be determined , she asked . Before an
individual 's amino acid deficiencies could be reliably determined , she said ,
multiple blood samples would be required over the course of the day , for
several days .


`` If they had a consistent pattern , you could maybe recommend adding something
to the diet -- but it would be better to add it to the diet than it would be to
give it to them in pills , '' Gietzen said , `` because they can tolerate it better
in a combination with other amino acids than singly . ''


Federal health officials who are investigating the outbreak of the blood
disease eosinophilia might shed some light on how much tryptophan is too much
if they find evidence of large doses in people who acquired the disease .


However , the fact that supplements have been widely used for years is seen as
an indication that the problem may be due instead to contamination of the
crystalline tryptophan powder imported from overseas .


Matthews of Cornell noted that , for his studies , he has to verify the purity of
the amino acid powder before administering it to research subjects -- and he
frequently finds contamination .


`` Time and time again I find some very strange impurities , '' Matthews said .
`` That , in my opinion , is one of the best places to look . ''


The Japanese have developed good methods for assuring purity of their product ,
but a change in procedures could result in contamination of new batches , he
said . In addition , the high price of Japanese amino acids would put economic
pressure on U.S. companies to mix them with cheaper products produced with less
quality control , he said .


He noted that the complex chemical methods used for making tryptophan and other
amino acids often involve toxic substances such as hydrogen cyanide .


`` We 're not talking about natural foods , '' he said . `` We 're talking about
specially prepared individual compounds . And in almost any case you can get the
same effect just by eating right . You can pick natural foods that are a little
bit richer in specific amino acids and get along just fine . ''


Wurtman , in his role as inadvertent father of the tryptophan craze , wants the
FDA to classify amino acids as drugs .


`` The sad truth is it probably works , '' he said of tryptophan . `` But I would hope
very much that the perception that these amino acids sold by the present route
may be causing big problems will cause us to rethink completely whether we
should allow them to be sold as so-called nutritional supplements . ''
